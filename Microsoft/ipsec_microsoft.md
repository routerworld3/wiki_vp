​Windows utilizes IPsec internally to enhance security through features like Domain Isolation, Server Isolation, and DirectAccess. For detailed information, you can refer to the following Microsoft documentation:

1. **Domain Isolation:**
   - This feature uses IPsec to restrict network communication to authenticated and authorized computers within a domain.
   - Documentation: [Domain Isolation Policy Design](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/jj721511(v=ws.11))

2. **Server Isolation:**
   - Server Isolation leverages IPsec to ensure that only trusted computers can communicate with specific servers, adding an extra layer of security.
   - Documentation: [Server Isolation Policy Design](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/jj721514(v=ws.11))

3. **DirectAccess:**
   - DirectAccess provides seamless and secure remote access to intranet resources using IPsec for encryption and authentication.
   - Documentation: [DirectAccess Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-access/directaccess/directaccess-overview)

These resources offer comprehensive insights into how Windows employs IPsec internally to secure communications within Active Directory-managed networks.
