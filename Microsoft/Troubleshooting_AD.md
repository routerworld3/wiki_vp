# 1. Overview of AD Troubleshooting

Active Directory (AD) requires consistent **monitoring** and **maintenance** to ensure:

- **Replication** is functioning between Domain Controllers (DCs).  
- **DNS** name resolution is correct and up-to-date.  
- **Secure Channels** (schannel) between client machines and DCs are stable.  
- **Time synchronization** is accurate across domain members.

## Key Commands

1. **repadmin** – Diagnoses and manages replication.  
2. **dcdiag** – Tests the health of AD and Domain Controllers.  
3. **nltest** – Checks the secure channel between machines and DC, verifies domain trusts, etc.  
4. **w32tm** – Diagnoses and configures Windows Time service.

- Enumerate **trusted domains** and perform additional domain/forest queries.  
- Verify the domain controller a workstation or server is currently authenticating against.

A **secure channel** is critical for maintaining a secure relationship between a domain member and the DC. If it breaks, the machine may fail to authenticate domain users or access domain resources.

### 4.2 Common Commands and Usage

| Command                                        | Description                                                                  | Example                                       |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `nltest /sc_query:<DomainName or ServerName>`  | Queries the secure channel status to the specified domain or server.         | `nltest /sc_query:MYDOMAIN`                   |
| `nltest /sc_verify:<DomainName>`               | Verifies the secure channel with the specified domain.                       | `nltest /sc_verify:MYDOMAIN`                  |
| `nltest /sc_reset:<DomainName>`                | Resets the secure channel with the specified domain.                         | `nltest /sc_reset:MYDOMAIN`                   |
| `nltest /dsgetdc:<DomainName>`                 | Finds a domain controller for the specified domain.                          | `nltest /dsgetdc:MYDOMAIN`                    |
| `nltest /dclist:<DomainName>`                  | Lists all domain controllers in a specified domain.                          | `nltest /dclist:MYDOMAIN`                     |

   ```powershell
   nltest /sc_query:MYDOMAIN
   ```

   - Verifies whether the local machine’s secure channel with `MYDOMAIN` is functional.

2. **Reset Secure Channel**

   ```powershell
   nltest /sc_reset:MYDOMAIN
   ```

   - Resets the secure channel with `MYDOMAIN` if verification fails.

| `w32tm /query /configuration`            | Displays the current Windows Time service configuration.                                              | `w32tm /query /configuration`                        |
| `w32tm /monitor`                         | Monitors the time of domain PCs and DCs; checks for offset.                                          | `w32tm /monitor /domain:MYDOMAIN                     |
| `w32tm /resync`                          | Forces the local computer to resynchronize its clock with the configured time source.                | `w32tm /resync`                                      |
| `w32tm /resync /rediscover`              | Forces a redetection of network resources and then performs a resync.                                | `w32tm /resync /rediscover`                          |
| `w32tm /stripchart /computer:<Hostname>` | Checks offset over time between the local computer and the specified remote computer/NTP server.      | `w32tm /stripchart /computer:time.windows.com`       |
| `w32tm /config`                          | Configures Windows Time service parameters (e.g., sets an NTP server or enables local as reliable).   | `w32tm /config /syncfromflags:manual /manualpeerlist:"time.windows.com"` |

### 5.3 Examples

1. **Check Time Status**

   ```powershell
   w32tm /query /status
   ```

   - Displays the local system’s time source, stratum, and offset.

2. **Force Time Resync**

   ```powershell
   w32tm /resync
   ```

   - Immediately contacts the configured NTP server (or domain hierarchy) for time updates.

3. **Check Offset with a Remote NTP Server**

   ```powershell
   w32tm /stripchart /computer:time.windows.com /dataonly /samples:5
   ```

   - Measures offset at intervals (5 samples) to `time.windows.com`.

4. **Configure Domain Controller as Reliable Time Source**

   ```powershell
   w32tm /config /reliable:yes /update
   net stop w32time && net start w32time
   ```

   - Marks the DC as a reliable time source and restarts the Windows Time service.

---

## 6. Best Practices

1. **Run Tools Regularly**  
   - Include `dcdiag`, `repadmin`, and time checks (`w32tm /query /status`) in routine health checks (e.g., weekly or monthly).

2. **Automate Health Checks**  
   - Script frequent checks and email the results. Example: A PowerShell script that runs `repadmin /replsummary` and `dcdiag /q` on all DCs.

3. **Secure Channel Checks**  
   - Use `nltest /sc_query:<DomainName>` especially when users report **“trust relationship”** or **“domain can’t be reached”** errors.

4. **DNS Validation**  
   - AD heavily relies on DNS. Verify that the DC’s host records and SRV records are registered (`nltest /dsregdns`), and ensure proper forwarders or root hints.

5. **Time Synchronization**  
   - Always ensure DCs and domain clients have correct time. Misconfigurations often break Kerberos authentication.

6. **Use Verbose and Suppressed Modes**  
   - `dcdiag /v` and `dcdiag /q` can offer both in-depth and high-level overviews.  
   - `repadmin /showrepl` (in-depth) vs. `repadmin /replsummary` (high-level).

7. **Document Changes**  
   - Keep a **change log** for modifications to DNS, time settings, or domain trust configurations. This helps with rollback or advanced troubleshooting.

## Secure Channel Or Schannel

**SChannel** (short for **Secure Channel**) generally refers to two related but distinct concepts in Windows environments:

1. **SChannel Security Support Provider (SSP)** – a Windows component (part of the Security Support Provider Interface or SSPI) that implements standard security protocols such as SSL and TLS for secure communications. This is sometimes just called **SChannel.dll** on Windows systems.

2. **Secure Channel (often called the “Netlogon secure channel”)** – the authenticated, encrypted channel established between a domain-joined computer (workstation, server, or domain controller) and a Domain Controller (DC). This secure channel is essential for:
   - Machine authentication (computer accounts).
   - User authentication (via Kerberos and NTLM).
   - Domain trust communications between domains/forests.

When people talk about **“SChannel in Active Directory,”** they are usually referring to the **secure channel** (Netlogon secure channel) that each domain member maintains with a Domain Controller. This secure channel:

- Uses the computer account’s *shared secret* (essentially the machine’s password) to authenticate and encrypt communication with the DC.  
- Must be kept valid. If the channel breaks—often from mismatched computer account passwords—the domain-joined machine can experience authentication errors and a “trust relationship” failure with the domain.  

### Key Points About the Secure Channel in AD

1. **Periodic Password Updates**  
   - By default, a machine account password is updated every 30 days.  
   - If something goes wrong and the local machine’s view of its password differs from what the DC believes it to be, the secure channel can fail.

2. **Troubleshooting Tools**  
   - **nltest**: Offers commands like `/sc_query` and `/sc_reset` to test or reset the secure channel.  
   - **Event Viewer**: Look in the **System** log for Netlogon or Secure Channel issues.  
   - **dcdiag**: While dcdiag primarily checks domain controller health, some of its tests may reveal secure channel–related errors if replication or authentication is impacted.

3. **Symptoms of a Broken Secure Channel**  
   - Users on that PC cannot log on with domain credentials.  
   - Error messages like **“The trust relationship between this workstation and the primary domain failed.”**  
   - Inability to access domain resources or Group Policy.

In summary, **SChannel** in the Active Directory context is most commonly understood as the **secure channel** required for domain members (including domain controllers) to communicate securely with one another, ensuring that authentication and other essential AD operations occur over a trusted, encrypted link.

### Schannel and RDP Authentication 

Below is a deeper dive into **why** an RDP logon fails when there is a **broken secure channel** (Netlogon schannel) on a domain-joined server or domain controller (DC), and **how** user authentication interacts with the machine’s own account authentication.

---

## 1. The Role of the Machine Account and Secure Channel

When a **Windows computer** (workstation, member server, or even a domain controller itself) joins a domain, it creates a **machine account** in Active Directory, just like a user account. This machine account:

1. Has a **password** (shared secret) that is periodically updated (by default, every 30 days).  
2. Establishes a **secure channel** (Netlogon schannel) with a DC.  

> **Secure channel** = An authenticated, encrypted connection between the domain-joined computer and the DC, allowing the computer to prove its identity to the domain and securely exchange credentials/tickets.

If that channel breaks (for instance, the stored machine password on the computer doesn’t match what AD expects), then the DC no longer trusts the machine. Authentication requests from that machine can fail because it is not recognized as a valid domain member.

---

## 2. How User Authentication Works During RDP Logon

When a user attempts to **Remote Desktop (RDP)** into a member server (or a DC), the following typically occurs:

1. **User Initiates RDP Connection**  
   - The user enters domain credentials (e.g., `UserName@DomainName` or `DOMAIN\UserName`).

2. **Server Validates Machine Identity**  
   - The RDP **target server** must authenticate **itself** to a domain controller to prove it is a legitimate domain member.  
   - This step uses the **server’s machine account** credentials over the Netlogon secure channel.

3. **User Credentials Are Forwarded for Verification**  
   - Once the server confirms it’s in good standing with the domain, it forwards the user’s authentication request to a DC for Kerberos or NTLM validation.  
   - The DC checks: “**Is the user legitimate? Is the server a valid domain member?**”

4. **DC Issues Authentication Tickets**  
   - For a successful Kerberos logon, the DC issues a **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)** to the user and a **Service Ticket** (TGS) for the RDP service (`TermService/<ServerName>`).  
   - Or if NTLM is used, the DC checks the user’s NT hash and session details.

5. **Server Allows the RDP Session**  
   - If the server and the user pass all checks, the RDP session is established.

---

### Where It Breaks if the Machine Account Is Bad

If the machine (the RDP target server) **cannot prove** it is a valid domain member—due to a **broken secure channel** or invalid machine password—the DC will **reject** authentication requests coming from that machine. This causes:

- **Intermittent or outright RDP failures** because the DC does not trust the server’s request to authenticate the user.  
- The user sees messages like **“The trust relationship between this workstation and the primary domain failed”** or generic logon failure messages.

---

## 3. Interaction of User and Machine Account Authentication

- **Machine Account Authentication** is the foundation: The domain must trust the computer’s identity first.  
- **User Authentication** relies on that existing trust to present user credentials to the DC.  

> If the computer’s secure channel is broken, **it cannot properly authenticate** to a DC. Consequently, **user logons** from that computer fail because the DC sees no legitimate, trusted channel through which the request is coming.

In other words:

1. **User** → logs onto **Server** → Server contacts **DC**  
2. DC checks **Server**’s identity via secure channel → Fails → The DC does not proceed to user authentication → RDP logon fails.

---

## 4. Why It Can Be “Intermittent”

If you have multiple domain controllers, or multiple servers, the user’s logon request might occasionally reach a **healthy DC** or a **different RDP target** whose secure channel is still valid. In larger environments, domain controller selection (via DNS, site affinity, etc.) can appear random to the end user. 

- **If** the request hits the **broken** DC or the broken server’s channel, the logon fails.  
- **If** the request hits a **healthy** DC or server channel, the user logs in without issue.

Thus, from a user’s perspective, it’s **intermittent** and difficult to pinpoint.

---

## 5. Events in the Event Viewer that Prove the Issue

Look especially for **Netlogon** events in the **System** log on the **server** (where RDP fails) and the **domain controller**. Common error event IDs:

- **3210 (Netlogon)**: “This computer could not authenticate with \\\\<DCName>...”  
- **5805 (Netlogon)**: “The session setup from the computer <Name> failed to authenticate...”  
- **5722 (Netlogon)**: “The session setup from the computer <Name> failed to authenticate... the DC was not able to verify the machine account password.”  

Any of these confirm a **machine account password mismatch** or secure channel failure. Correlate their timestamps with the exact times users fail RDP logins, and you have direct evidence of cause-and-effect.

---

## 6. How to Resolve

1. **Reset the Secure Channel**  
   - On the affected server, run:
     ```powershell
     nltest /sc_verify:<DomainName>
     nltest /sc_reset:<DomainName>
     ```
     or use PowerShell:
     ```powershell
     Reset-ComputerMachinePassword -Server <HealthyDCName> -Credential (Get-Credential)
     ```

2. **Rejoin the Domain (Last Resort)**  
   - If resetting fails, **remove** the server from the domain, **reboot**, and then **rejoin** it to the domain.

3. **Check DC Health**  
   - If the issue is with the **domain controller** machine account (e.g., `DC1`’s account is broken), you might need to reset **that** DC’s secure channel or fix replication issues:
     ```powershell
     dcdiag /v
     repadmin /replsummary
     ```

4. **Verify DNS**  
   - Ensure the server can properly **locate** DCs and SRV records in DNS.

5. **Monitor Netlogon and System Logs**  
   - Confirm that subsequent RDP logons succeed without Netlogon errors.

---

### Key Takeaways

- A **broken machine account** (secure channel mismatch) on the RDP target server **directly** leads to user logon failures because the DC will not trust requests from an unverified or “unknown” machine.  
- **User authentication** depends on a valid **machine account authentication**. Both must succeed, or the user can’t log on.  
- The best proof is correlating **Netlogon error events** (ID 3210, 5805, 5722, etc.) with **failed RDP attempts** in real-time or by checking logs.  

## BACKUP 

Below is an overview of **non-authoritative** and **authoritative** restores in the context of **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**—including why one would choose each method, and the impact on **Domain Controller (DC)** identity (especially when DC certificates or GUID-based references are involved, such as in certain **DoD environments**).

---

## 1. Non-Authoritative Restore

A **non-authoritative restore** (often the *default* or *normal* restore method) means you restore your DC from a backup, but then **allow the rest of the AD environment to “correct” or update** that DC with the latest changes. In other words, the DC’s database (NTDS.dit) is treated as *outdated* compared to other replication partners after the restore, and it will:

1. **Boot up** with the backup’s AD state.  
2. **Contact other DCs** for replication.  
3. Receive and incorporate **all changes** made since the backup.  

### Why Use Non-Authoritative Restore?
- **Server Crashes / Hardware Failures**: You just need to get the DC back online without overwriting newer AD data that other DCs have.  
- **Typical DC Restoration**: In multi-DC environments, each DC has a read/write copy of AD. The domain’s up-to-date state is maintained on other DCs, so the restored DC can re-synchronize.  
- **Easy & Common**: This is the normal approach for DR (Disaster Recovery) if you have multiple healthy DCs in your domain.

### Potential Pitfalls
- **USN (Update Sequence Number) Considerations**: If the backup is very old (beyond **tombstone lifetime**), or if it’s restored improperly, you risk **USN rollback**.  
- **Machine Account Password Mismatch**: If the DC’s machine account password changed after the backup, you might need to reset the secure channel or rejoin the DC.  

In a **non-authoritative restore**, **no object** on that DC is considered “the newest version” simply by virtue of restoring. The rest of the domain will push the “current AD state” to the DC.

---

## 2. Authoritative Restore

An **authoritative restore** is used when you want to **force specific objects** (or entire containers) in AD to be **treated as the authoritative (latest) version** across all DCs. Essentially, you’re saying:

> “I want the AD data from my backup to overwrite whatever currently exists in the domain for these objects.”

In an authoritative restore:

1. You use **Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM)** on a DC.  
2. Run **ntdsutil** or similar tools to mark specific objects (or entire subtree) as authoritative.  
3. Increment their version numbers so that **other DCs** replicate *that* data as the newest copy.  

### Why Use Authoritative Restore?
- **Accidental Bulk Deletions**: Example: someone deletes an entire OU with thousands of user accounts. You want to bring them back exactly as they were before deletion.  
- **Critical AD Object Recovery**: Restoring GPOs, or system objects (FSMO roles, etc.) that were removed or changed incorrectly.

### Potential Pitfalls
- **Overwriting Current Changes**: If those objects have legitimately changed since your backup, an authoritative restore can revert them to an older state domain-wide.  
- **Selective Object Restore**: Typically, you only mark *necessary* objects authoritative, not the entire directory, to avoid reintroducing stale data.  
- **Complex Process**: Must be done carefully to avoid replication conflicts.

## 3. DC Identity, Certificates, and GUID Issues 

In a **Department of Defense (DoD)** or other high-security environment, Domain Controllers often have **certificates** for smart card logons, LDAPS, or other secure communications. These certificates can be tied to:

- The **DC’s AD object GUID**.
- The **DNS host name** and the DC’s **unique attributes** in AD.

**Restoring** a DC (especially if it’s an old backup or done incorrectly) can cause:

1. **Object GUID Mismatch**:  
   - If the DC object in AD was removed/recreated or if the backup is extremely old, you might introduce a **new** DC object with a different GUID.  
   - The old certificate (tied to the old GUID) may no longer be valid or recognized.

2. **Machine Account Password / Secure Channel**:  
   - The DC’s computer account password in AD might be *more recent* than what the restored DC thinks it is. Authentication issues result.

3. **Certificate Renewal**:  
   - If your environment auto-enrolls DC certificates (such as DoD Common Access Card or other PKI deployments), reintroducing a DC from an old state might break that enrollment. You could have to **manually reissue** or **enroll** the DC certificate again.

### Why “It Makes Things Difficult”
- **Strict Policy / PKI**: DoD policies often have tight requirements for matching GUIDs, certificate templates, and auditing.  
- **Secure Channels**: If the DC can’t prove it’s the valid identity it once was, all sorts of domain trust and netlogon issues arise.  
- **No Quick Workarounds**: You can’t just rename or forcibly fix the GUID. You might need a careful demotion or a **metadata cleanup** in AD, followed by a re-promotion and new certificates.

---

## 4. Best Practices to Avoid Problems

1. **Use Supported Backups**  
   - Ensure you do **system state backups** that are not beyond the **tombstone lifetime**.  
   - If you must restore, use **non-authoritative** unless you specifically need to recover deleted objects.

2. **Limit Authoritative Restores**  
   - Only do them for *objects you truly need to resurrect.*  
   - Mark *only* those objects as authoritative in **ntdsutil** so you don’t blow away legitimate changes in AD.

3. **Plan for DC Rebuild**  
   - In many modern AD environments, it’s often simpler to **build a new DC** or demote/promote rather than restore an old backup.  
   - Rely on your healthy DCs to keep the directory consistent.

4. **Check DC Certificates**  
   - If your DC has PKI-based authentication or has a **DoD certificate** bound to its GUID, consider the impact of the restore on that certificate.  
   - You may need to **re-enroll** for a new certificate to align with the current DC object in AD.

5. **Run Health Checks**  
   - After a restore (of any kind), run:
     ```powershell
     dcdiag /v
     repadmin /replsummary
     ```
     and confirm no USN rollback or replication errors.  
   - Verify netlogon, certificates, and secure channel:
     ```powershell
     nltest /sc_query:<DomainName>
     ```

---

### Summary

- **Non-authoritative Restore**: Commonly used, the DC’s data is brought online but then updated (“corrected”) by other DCs.  
- **Authoritative Restore**: Specifically used when you need to *push* older data as the *current, official* version across the domain—usually to recover accidentally deleted objects.  

In environments requiring **DoD certificates** or specialized GUID-based checks, a DC restore can be more complicated because it can cause **GUID mismatches**, break **machine account** trust, or invalidate DC certificates. Always verify the correct method of restore, confirm the DC’s identity in AD, and reissue any necessary certificates to ensure a **secure, functional** domain.

## Active Directory Roles 

Below is a **table-format summary** of each **FSMO (Flexible Single Master Operations) role** in Active Directory, along with its **primary function** and **commands to verify** which Domain Controller currently holds that role. 

---

| **FSMO Role**                  | **Primary Function**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Command (netdom)**               | **Command (PowerShell)**                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Schema Master**              | Manages changes to the **Active Directory schema** (e.g., adding new object classes or attributes). Only the Schema Master can make schema updates, which then replicate to all DCs in the forest.                                                                                                                           | `netdom query fsmo`  <br/>Checks which DC holds **Schema Master** along with all other roles.                              | `Get-ADForest \| Select-Object SchemaMaster` <br/>Displays which DC hosts the Schema Master.                                                                                                               |
| **Domain Naming Master**       | Controls the addition or removal of **domains** and **application partitions** in the forest. Responsible for ensuring globally unique naming of domains within the forest.                                                                                                                                                  | `netdom query fsmo`  <br/>Checks which DC holds **Domain Naming Master**.                                                   | `Get-ADForest \| Select-Object DomainNamingMaster` <br/>Shows the DC that holds the Domain Naming Master role.                                                                                              |
| **PDC Emulator**               | Acts as the **Primary Domain Controller** for legacy client support, time synchronization, and **password lockout** handling. Also processes **password changes** and coordinates Group Policy updates. In modern AD, it’s the source for **time** in the domain and the “go-to” DC for password authentication conflicts.         | `netdom query fsmo`  <br/>Indicates which DC is the **PDC** role holder.                                                    | `Get-ADDomain \| Select-Object PDCEmulator` <br/>Identifies the PDC Emulator in the domain.                                                                                                                 |
| **RID (Relative ID) Master**   | Allocates **RID pools** to other DCs to ensure unique **Security Identifiers (SIDs)** for newly created objects (users, groups, etc.). Without a functioning RID Master, DCs might run out of RIDs and fail to create new accounts.                                                                                          | `netdom query fsmo`  <br/>Shows which DC is the **RID Master**.                                                            | `Get-ADDomain \| Select-Object RIDMaster` <br/>Reveals the DC that holds the RID Master role.                                                                                                                |
| **Infrastructure Master**      | Maintains **cross-domain references** (phantoms) and **object references** for users/groups from other domains. Ensures references remain consistent when objects are moved or renamed. In a single-domain forest, it can be on the same DC as the Global Catalog; in multi-domain forests, it should not be on a GC (best practice). | `netdom query fsmo`  <br/>Lists which DC is the **Infrastructure Master**.                                                | `Get-ADDomain \| Select-Object InfrastructureMaster` <br/>Indicates the DC holding the Infrastructure Master role.                                                                                           |

## Additional Verification Methods

1. **Using `dcdiag`**  
   ```bash
   dcdiag /test:knowsofroleholders /v
   ```
   - Reports which domain controllers are aware of the current FSMO role holders.  

2. **Using Active Directory Users and Computers (GUI)**  
   - Right-click the domain name → **Operations Masters...** to see the **PDC**, **RID**, and **Infrastructure** roles for that domain.  
   - For **Domain Naming Master**, open **Active Directory Domains and Trusts** → right-click **Active Directory Domains and Trusts** → **Operations Master**.  
   - For **Schema Master**, register the **Active Directory Schema** snap-in (if not already), and check **Operations Masters** there.  

3. **Best Practices**  
   - **Document** which DCs hold each role.  
   - **Periodically check** role holders, especially after DC promotions/demotions.  
   - **Transfer or seize** roles carefully if a DC goes offline permanently or experiences failure.

---

**In summary**, to quickly view all FSMO role holders using the **command line**, run:
```bash
netdom query fsmo
```
Or with **PowerShell** (assuming the AD module is installed):
```powershell
Get-ADDomain | Select-Object PDCEmulator,RIDMaster,InfrastructureMaster
Get-ADForest | Select-Object DomainNamingMaster,SchemaMaster
```
This ensures you know exactly which DC hosts each role and can monitor or transfer them as needed.

## Event Log For Troubeshooting 

Below is a **table-format summary** of **common Kerberos, Netlogon, and AD replication event IDs**, including their **typical sequence**, **source**, and **what they indicate**. The table is roughly in **chronological order** for Kerberos authentication events (what usually succeeds or fails first), followed by **Netlogon** and **replication** events to watch for when troubleshooting. 

> **Note**: Actual log sequence may vary by scenario, but the Kerberos events often appear in the **Security** log, whereas Netlogon and replication errors appear in the **System** or **Directory Service** logs.

| **Event ID** | **Source**                      | **Typical Scenario**                                                                 | **Description**                                                                                                                                                 | **Notes / Causes**                                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1083**     | **NTDS Replication**            | Occurs during inbound replication                                                    | “Active Directory could not update the following object ... because of a name collision.”                                                                      | - Indicates a **naming collision** or possible lingering object.  <br/> - May require using `repadmin /removelingeringobjects` or conflict resolution.                      |
| **1084**     | **NTDS Replication**            | Related to inbound replication failures                                              | “Active Directory could not update the following object ... because the object is out of date.”                                                                | - A sign of replication problems or version mismatch.                                                                                                                       |
| **2102** / **2103** | **Directory Service** (sometimes labeled as **ActiveDirectory_DomainService**) | Directory service startup or replication monitor issues                               | **2102**: “Process MAD.EXE ... failed to start.” <br> **2103**: “Process MAD.EXE ... is monitoring replication.” These indicate internal AD DS or replication monitor states. | - Might show up if AD DS is having trouble starting or monitoring replication. <br/> - Check the **System** and **Directory Service** logs for additional error context.   |
| **2013** / **2042** | **Directory Service**     | Lingering or tombstone-lifetime issues                                               | **2013**: “The local domain controller has attempted to replicate the following object...” <br/> **2042**: “It has been too long since this machine replicated.” | - **2042** is the “tombstone lifetime exceeded” event, suggesting potential **USN rollback** or replication from a stale DC.                                                  |

## How They Typically Interrelate

1. **Kerberos Events (4768, 4771, 4769)**  
   - Appear in the **Security log** on the **Domain Controller** granting or denying tickets.  
   - Help diagnose user logon failures (wrong password, clock skew, account issues).

2. **Netlogon (3210, 5722, 5723, 5805)**  
   - Usually in the **System log** (on DCs or domain members).  
   - Indicate secure channel or machine account authentication failures.

3. **Replication Events (NTDS or Directory Service)**  
   - Appear in the **Directory Service** log on DCs.  
   - Show if domain controllers are replicating AD data correctly or if there are collisions, lingering objects, or stale DCs.

### Key Troubleshooting Tips

- **Correlate Timestamps**: If users cannot log on (Kerberos errors **4768 → 4771**), check if the machine or DC logs show Netlogon **3210/5722** events at the same time.  
- **Verify Replication**: If DCs aren’t replicating (events **1083/1084/2102/2103**), it can lead to stale credentials or outdated computer account passwords, causing Netlogon failures.  
- **Use Tools**:  
  - `dcdiag /v` and `repadmin /replsummary` to check **DC health**.  
  - `nltest /sc_query:<domain>` to verify **secure channel**.  
  - **Event Viewer** (Security, System, Directory Service logs) to find these event IDs.  

By watching for these **Event IDs** and understanding their sequence, you can pinpoint where **Kerberos** or **Netlogon** authentication is failing, or whether **AD replication** issues are contributing to login errors.
