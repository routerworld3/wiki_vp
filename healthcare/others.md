## 1 | Contract as a **network provider**  

Most physicians, hospitals, home‑health agencies, pharmacies, DME suppliers, labs, rehab therapists, etc. simply **enroll with DMAS** and then sign contracts with each of the six Cardinal Care MCOs whose members they want to serve. New providers first obtain a Virginia Medicaid ID via the online **Provider Enrollment & Revalidation** portal. citeturn0search8  

*Why it’s attractive:* no capitation risk; you bill either the MCO or fee‑for‑service (FFS) Medicaid after the short “initial eligibility” period.

## 2 | Deliver **long‑term services & supports (LTSS)**  

Virginia spends roughly one‑third of its Medicaid budget on LTSS. Opportunities include:

| LTSS segment | Typical provider types | How you contract |
|--------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| **HCBS waiver services** (personal care, respite, adult day, environmental mods, assistive tech) | Licensed home‑care agencies, adult day centers, contractors | Enroll with DMAS, then contract with the member’s MCO under the **CCC Plus** benefit. |
| **Nursing facilities & assisted living** | Nursing homes, ALFs with sufficient staffing | Dual tracks: DMAS FFS + all CCC Plus MCOs. |
| **PACE** (Program of All‑inclusive Care for the Elderly) | Organizations that can operate a clinic/day‑center and employ a geriatric IDT | Apply to DMV/DHS **PACE** program, sign a three‑way CMS/DMAS/PACE agreement, receive its own capitated rate. citeturn0search1 |

## 3 | Join **carved‑out benefit programs**  

Some services are run through single statewide contractors instead of (or in addition to) the MCOs:

| Carve‑out | Statewide prime contractor | Business roles still open |
|-----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Dental – Cardinal Care Smiles** | **DentaQuest** is the dental benefits administrator | Any dentist or oral‑surgery practice can join DentaQuest’s network and bill directly. citeturn1search0 |
| **Non‑Emergency Medical Transportation (NEMT)** | **ModivCare** (broker) | • Operate wheelchair vans, ambulances, or sedan services under subcontract. <br>• Provide dispatch/IT solutions. citeturn0search3turn0search7 |
| **Behavioral‑health Services Administrator (BHSA)** for remaining FFS members | **Kepro** took over from Magellan in 2023 | Out‑patient BH/SUD clinics enroll with Kepro for authorizations and with each MCO for managed‑care patients. citeturn2search0turn2search2 |

## 4 | Partner with MCOs on **value‑based & supplemental services**  

Every Virginia Medicaid MCO is expected to hit quality and value‑based payment (VBP) targets—so they look for provider or vendor partners that can:

* Run **care‑management** or remote‑patient‑monitoring programs (e.g., CCM for diabetes, CHF).  
* Deliver **in‑lieu‑of** or **SDOH** services such as medically tailored meals, housing navigation, or digital CBT apps.  
* Operate **alternative payment models** (shared‑savings primary‑care capitation, maternity bundles, hospital quality gain‑sharing).

These deals are negotiated directly with the plan and usually include upside incentives but limited downside financial risk for smaller providers.

## 5 | Offer **support services or technology** to DMAS or the plans

| Niche | Examples of recent contracts |
|-------|------------------------------|
| **Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) modules** | Claims editing, data warehouse, provider portal, electronic visit verification (EVV) |
| **Fraud, waste, & abuse analytics** | Predictive analytics vendors supporting DMAS Program Integrity |
| **Telehealth platforms** | Secure video, e‑consult, asynchronous dermatology tools adopted by MCOs |
| **Member engagement** | Multilingual call‑center, texting, or AI chatbots for redetermination outreach |

These opportunities flow through formal RFPs on the **eVA** procurement portal or through each MCO’s vendor acquisition process.

## 6 | Become a **Provider‑Sponsored Organization (PSO)** or “delegated entity”  

Large delivery systems—especially hospital networks or FQHC consortia—sometimes stand up limited‑scope risk entities:

* **PSO / Provider‑led plan:** take partial capitation for a defined population while subcontracting actuarial and claims admin to an established insurer.  
* **Health Home** for high‑need chronic conditions (pending CMS approval in Virginia).  
* **ACO‑like arrangements** with upside/downside risk written into the MCO contract.

This route involves more regulatory filing and capital requirements than simple network participation but *much* less than licensing a full MCO.

## 7 | Checklist to enter the Virginia market

1. **Licensure & NPI** for your provider type (state Board of Health Professions, BHDS, or VDSS).  
2. **DMAS Medicaid provider enrollment** → receive Medicaid ID. citeturn0search8  
3. **Contract with each MCO** you wish to serve; negotiate rates or VBP amendments.  
4. For carve‑outs, **apply to the prime contractor** (DentaQuest, ModivCare, Kepro, etc.).  
5. Monitor **eVA** and DMAS bulletins for upcoming RFPs or program changes.

### Take‑away

Even if you never become an MCO, Virginia Medicaid offers a spectrum of revenue‑bearing roles—from traditional fee‑for‑service billing to running a PACE center, providing waiver services, or supplying tele‑health and analytics solutions to the state and its six health plans. The business model you choose will dictate your risk level, contracting pathway, and capital needs—so map those carefully before jumping in.
