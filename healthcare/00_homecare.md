| Decision          | What it means for Virginia                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Key Reg refs                                                              |
| ----------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------a------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Service scope** | “Non-medical” in Virginia is **Personal Care / Home-care attendant services** delivered in the client’s residence. If you will *also* offer any skilled nursing or therapies the agency is treated as a full Home-Care Organization (HCO). | 12VAC5-381-10 & FAQ in VDH checklist ([Virginia Regulatory Town Hall][1]) |
| **Payer mix**     | • Private-pay • Long-term-care insurance • **Virginia Medicaid (CCC Plus, EPSDT, etc.)** • MCO contracts. Medicaid is optional, but most agencies rely on it for volume.                                                                   | DMAS provider pages ([Virginia Medicaid][2])                              |

### 2  |  Secure Your *Virginia* Home-Care Organization (HCO) license

1. **Study the rule book** – *Regulations for the Licensure of Home Care Organizations* (12VAC5-381).([Virginia Law][3])
2. **Build the required document set** (policies, QA plan, emergency plan, org-chart, job descriptions, forms, etc.). Use the VDH **“Home-Care Licensure Survey Checklist”** as your packing list.([Virginia Regulatory Town Hall][1])
3. **File the application + \$500 fee** with the Office of Licensure & Certification (OLC).([Virginia Regulatory Town Hall][1])
4. **Attend the optional pre-licensure conference**; when ready, OLC schedules an **on-site survey**. You must show:

   * Lease or deed for an office (records privacy, locked storage).
   * Administrator & RN supervisor credentials (RN can be contract if scope is non-skilled).
   * Liability insurance (\$1 M typical).
   * Two *fully hired* employee files per discipline to demonstrate compliance (TB screen, background check, competencies).
5. **Pass survey → OLC issues the initial one-year license**. Renewal moves to a two-year cycle once you have a compliance history.

### 3  |  Enroll as a **Virginia Medicaid provider** (optional but common)

| Step                                                                                                                                                                        | Detail / Tip                                                          | Reg / Source             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1. Create MES/PRSS account                                                                                                                                                  | PRSS is the Provider Portal inside DMAS’s Medicaid Enterprise System. | ([Virginia Medicaid][2]) |
| 2. Choose taxonomy **“Agency-Directed Personal Care”** (and Respite/Companion if offered) and submit enrollment packet (license, NPI, W-9, EFT form, ownership disclosure). |                                                                       |                          |
| 3. Credential with each **Managed Care Organization (Aetna, Anthem, Optima, Molina, United, Humana)** – they manage the bulk of CCC Plus members.                           |                                                                       |                          |
| 4. **Revalidate every ≤ 5 yrs** to keep your Medicaid ID active.                                                                                                            | ([Virginia Medicaid][2])                                              |                          |

### 4  |  Understand Medicaid clinical & billing mechanics

* **LTSS screening** – before services start, the local hospital or community screening team completes the Uniform Assessment Instrument (UAI) to confirm nursing-facility level of care.([Virginia Medicaid][4])
* **Service authorization** – hours are set with form DMAS-97A or via MCO portal. Standard soft caps: **8.5 hrs/day (34 units)** and **≈ 56 hrs/week**, with exceptions for high-need cases.([Virginia Medicaid][5], [Virginia Medicaid][6])
* **Electronic Visit Verification (EVV)** – all agency-directed personal-care visits must transmit 6 data points (who, what, when, where, why, how-long) under 12VAC30-60-65.([Virginia Medicaid][7])
* **Billing codes** – T2027 or S5125 in 15-minute units; claims are rejected if EVV data are missing after 09/01/2020.([Virginia Medicaid][5])

### 5  |  Build Your Operating Infrastructure

| Area                  | Minimum Virginia standard                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Staffing ratios**   | RN Supervisor available 24×7; conducts initial assessment & 90-day supervisory visits. Attendants must complete 40 hrs orientation + 12 hrs annual in-service. External criminal-record check + TB screen. |
| **Policies & QA**     | Written PI/QI program reviewed annually; infection-control plan; client-rights & complaint policy; emergency preparedness (all-hazards, evacuation, continuity).                                           |
| **Technology stack**  | HIPAA-compliant EMR / EVV platform, secure texting, payroll/HCM, Medicaid clearinghouse.                                                                                                                   |
| **Insurance & bonds** | General & professional liability, workers’ comp, employee dishonesty bond, cyber-liability (strongly advised).                                                                                             |
| **Compliance checks** | Monthly OIG/GSA exclusion scans, OSHA logs, data-privacy training.                                                                                                                                         |

### 6  |  Launch & Grow

1. **Marketing/referral channels** – hospital discharge planners, Area Agencies on Aging, care coordinators in each MCO, senior-living communities.
2. **Negotiate MCO contract rates** – Virginia is fee-schedule driven, but MCOs can add *in-network* add-ons (mileage, overtime policies).
3. **Cash-flow planning** – expect 30-45 day lag on Medicaid claims; keep 2–3 months payroll in reserve.
4. **Metrics to track** – caregiver-turnover %, visit-cancel rate, QA audit scores, EVV compliance %, days-sales-outstanding.

### 7  |  Where consultancies fit

Firms such as the one you found can draft the policy manual, prep you for the survey, and stand up EVV/billing systems. Their value is speed and templates; the **regulatory responsibility and ultimate compliance still rests with your agency**. Make sure any consultant’s materials map explicitly to each numbered section of 12VAC5-381 so you can show surveyors the cross-walk.
