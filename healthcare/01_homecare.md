*21st Century walks you through each block; your pace depends on how quickly you supply documents, finish hiring, and schedule survey dates.*

### Quick Reality-Check Before You Sign

1. **Clarify scope creep** – ask for a written schedule of *what is billable* if revisions exceed the included hours (e.g., extra website customisation, additional survey coaching).
2. **Timeline guarantees** – get target durations in writing (entity formation ≈ 1 wk, license packet ≈ 4-6 wks once you deliver résumés, survey pass rate, etc.).
3. **Post-launch support window** – confirm how long you retain access to consultants after opening (many items are “lifetime,” others renew annually).
4. **Local market due-diligence** – the package is national; wage surveys, competitor pricing, and caregiver supply analysis in *Virginia* are still on you.
