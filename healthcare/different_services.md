### 1 | **Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS)**

**What services are provided?**  
Personal care, companion care, respite, private-duty nursing, adult day care, assistive tech, environmental modifications, and more under CCC Plus waiver or DD waivers (CL/FIS).

**Typical provider types:**  
Home care agencies (licensed), adult day centers, and independent aides (some with consumer-direction).

**Hampton Roads market:**  
Very competitive. Large providers like **Bayada**, **Interim Healthcare**, **Comfort Keepers**, and local agencies like **Heaven Sent**, **BestCare**, etc., are active in the area. The demand is high due to a large elderly and disabled population, but **staffing shortages are a constant bottleneck**, so new providers who can **reliably staff aides and RNs** have room to grow.

### 2 | **PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly)**

**What services are provided?**  
Comprehensive medical + social care: adult day care, physician, nursing, therapies, meals, transportation, home health, Rx — all **under one roof** for frail seniors eligible for both Medicare + Medicaid.

**Provider type:**  
A single PACE organization operating a licensed site (must meet CMS facility and IDT requirements).

**Hampton Roads market:**  
One of the few areas in Virginia **with multiple PACE providers**, including:

- **InnovAge Virginia PACE** (Norfolk, Newport News)
- **Riverside PACE** (Hampton, Portsmouth, Suffolk)
- **Sentara PACE** (Virginia Beach)

This space is **heavily regulated** and **saturated** in Tidewater. New entry would likely require buying into an existing program or expanding into underserved localities further west/south.

### 3 | **Dental Services (Smiles For Children – via DentaQuest)**

**What services are provided?**  
Preventive (cleanings, fluoride, sealants), restorative (fillings, crowns), oral surgery (extractions), and some ortho for children; limited adult services (e.g., extractions, some preventive/restorative).

**Provider type:**  
Any licensed dentist enrolled with **DentaQuest**.

**Hampton Roads market:**  
**Extensive provider base**, especially for pediatric dental. But waitlists are still common. Adult dental coverage was expanded in 2021, so the market is growing. Larger chains like **Kool Smiles**, **Aspen Dental**, and **Greenbrier Dental Center**, plus many solo/local providers, operate here. Specialty dental (oral surgery, endodontics) is less saturated.

---

### 4 | **Non-Emergency Medical Transportation (NEMT)**

**What services are provided?**  
Scheduled transport to/from Medicaid appointments — via sedan, wheelchair van, stretcher, or ambulance — including recurring dialysis, therapy, and behavioral health visits.

**Provider type:**  
Transportation companies subcontracted by **ModivCare**, Virginia’s statewide NEMT broker.

**Hampton Roads market:**  
Dense market due to high population and urban sprawl. Dozens of NEMT operators serve the region—ranging from solo van operators to larger fleets like:

- **Accu-Care Transportation**
- **Bay Transit (public)**
- **Agape Transportation**

But high demand = **missed rides and scheduling issues are still common**, so ModivCare often needs **new vendors with reliability and coverage in early/late hours**.

---

### 5 | **Behavioral Health Services (via MCOs + Kepro for FFS)**

**What services are provided?**  
Outpatient therapy, psychiatry, crisis intervention, peer support, substance use disorder treatment, TDT (intensive in-home), residential treatment for youth, ACT, and MH skill-building.

**Provider type:**  
Outpatient clinics, solo LCSWs or LPCs, community mental health agencies, peer-run centers.

**Hampton Roads market:**  
High need area with **many established players**, including:

- **Compass Behavioral Health**
- **Pinnacle Treatment Centers**
- **Western Tidewater CSB**
- **Family Insight**
- **FCS (Family Counseling Services)**

New behavioral health providers have room if they bring **specialized services** (e.g., bilingual care, adolescent SUD, tele-behavioral health) or can **expand to underserved zip codes** (South Norfolk, Franklin, parts of Suffolk).
