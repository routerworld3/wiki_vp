When you have a **central egress** design (where all outbound traffic from multiple spoke VPCs goes through a single inspection/Egress VPC), the default pattern is to have one NAT Gateway (or a pair, for HA) that all traffic uses after inspection. If you want **different NAT IPs** per spoke *and* still have centralized inspection, you need to modify the standard design slightly so that, after the firewall, traffic can be sent to **different NAT Gateways** depending on the source CIDR.

Below is a conceptual outline of how it can work:

---

## 1. Standard “Central Egress” flow (baseline)

1. **Spoke VPC**: Routes `0.0.0.0/0` to a Transit Gateway (TGW).  
2. **TGW** (Pre-inspection RT): Sends all spoke egress traffic into the **Inspection VPC** (where AWS Network Firewall resides).  
3. **Network Firewall**: Inspects the traffic, enforces security policies, then sends “allowed” traffic *back* out to the TGW.  
4. **TGW** (Post-inspection RT): Forwards the now-inspected traffic to the **Egress VPC**.  
5. **Egress VPC**: Houses a NAT Gateway (plus an Internet Gateway). All traffic uses that single NAT IP by default.

In that default model, every spoke shares the same NAT EIP because they all go to the same NAT Gateway.  

---

## 2. Introducing multiple NAT Gateways for different source CIDRs

To break out traffic by source VPC/CIDR (so that each spoke has a unique NAT EIP), you have two main choices:

### **A. Multiple NAT Gateways in the same Egress VPC**

1. **Create multiple NAT Gateways** (one per spoke or per group of spokes), each with its own Elastic IP.  
2. In the **Egress VPC route tables**, differentiate where traffic goes based on **source**. 
   - By default, VPC routing only looks at *destination*. That’s why you would use either:  
     - **VPC Ingress Routing** features (AWS Network Firewall or a 3rd-party appliance) to do a “policy-based” routing or NAT.  
     - A **firewall endpoint** that can NAT traffic differently, depending on source CIDR.  

   For example, if you’re using **AWS Network Firewall** in the Egress VPC (sometimes called “firewall chaining” or “ingress routing”), you might configure rules like:  
   - “If source is 10.1.0.0/16, forward to NAT-GW-#1.”  
   - “If source is 10.2.0.0/16, forward to NAT-GW-#2.”  

3. Outbound traffic is still “centrally inspected” since it came from the central inspection step in the dedicated Inspection VPC. You can also run a final check in the Egress VPC, if desired.  

**Key point:** AWS route tables alone will not do “source-based” next-hop. You must use a firewall endpoint or an appliance that can see the source IP and then forward accordingly.

### **B. Separate “Mini-Egress” VPCs** per spoke

Instead of one big Egress VPC, you create multiple small egress VPCs, each with its own NAT Gateway and EIP. Then in your **Post-inspection TGW route table**, you say:

- For Spoke A’s CIDR (10.1.0.0/16), next-hop is “Egress-VPC-A.”  
- For Spoke B’s CIDR (10.2.0.0/16), next-hop is “Egress-VPC-B.”

This approach is simpler from a NAT routing perspective (you don’t have to do source-based routing inside a single VPC), but each “mini” egress VPC becomes an environment of its own to maintain.

---

## 3. Why “VPC Ingress Routing” matters here

In AWS, normal route tables make *destination-based* decisions. To direct certain **source** CIDRs to different NAT Gateways, you need a mechanism that can see and act on the source IP. One way is:

- **AWS Network Firewall** in “ingress routing” mode (or “VPC routing enhancements” mode). Traffic entering the VPC from the TGW is forced via route table to the Network Firewall endpoint. The firewall can then do NAT or route selection based on the *source* IP.  

If you **don’t** have that capability, you’ll be stuck with “0.0.0.0/0 → NAT-Gateway-#1” in the Egress VPC route table, meaning everything goes to the same NAT IP.

---

## 4. Putting it all together for *central egress filtering*

1. **Central inspection** still happens in your primary **Inspection VPC**. Traffic from each spoke is inspected exactly once before going to the Egress layer.  
2. **Inside** the Egress layer (whether it’s a single Egress VPC or multiple “mini-egress” VPCs), you distribute traffic to different NAT Gateways based on source CIDR.  
3. **Final egress** to the Internet:  
   - Each NAT Gateway has its own EIP, so Spoke A egresses with EIP “.5,” Spoke B egresses with EIP “.6,” and so on.  
   - All egress traffic has already gone through your firewall at least once (the central inspection step), satisfying the “central egress filtering” requirement.

Hence, you *can* preserve a single, central firewall for egress filtering *and* still break out NAT IP addresses per spoke. The main differences from the baseline are (1) extra NAT Gateways, (2) some form of “source-based” routing or NAT policy, and (3) small route table or firewall rule customizations to differentiate traffic.
