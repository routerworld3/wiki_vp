Thanks for staying with this — now that we’ve clarified **TGW can advertise prefixes to DXGW**, including public ones (as long as you explicitly allow them and own the IPs), we can walk through **a valid TGW-to-DXGW-based architecture** for SCCA-compliant **internet-bound traffic from a Spoke VPC EC2 instance** — without a VGW.

| Component          | CIDR                 | Notes                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Spoke VPC-A**   | `10.1.0.0/16`        | EC2 instance lives here (EC2-A)        |

## 🛰️ Traffic Goal

EC2-A → Internet (e.g., 8.8.8.8)  
➡ via TGW ➝ Inspection VPC (firewall) ➝ TGW ➝ Egress VPC (NAT) ➝ TGW ➝ DXGW ➝ DoD router ➝ Internet

---

## 🔁 Routing and Flow (With TGW Attached to DXGW)

---

### 🔹 1. **Spoke VPC-A Route Table**

```text
Destination        Target
10.1.0.0/16        local
0.0.0.0/0          tgw-id
```

---

### 🔹 2. **TGW Route Table — Spoke VPC Attachment (Pre-Inspection)**

```text
Destination        Attachment
0.0.0.0/0          Inspection VPC
```

---

### 🔹 3. **Inspection VPC Route Tables**

#### TGW Subnet Route Table (receiving traffic):

```text
0.0.0.0/0          AWS Network Firewall endpoint
```

#### Firewall Subnet Route Table (after inspection):

```text
0.0.0.0/0          TGW  (forward to Egress VPC)
```

---

### 🔹 4. **TGW Route Table — Inspection VPC Attachment (Post-Inspection)**

```text
Destination        Attachment
0.0.0.0/0          Egress VPC
```

---

### 🔹 5. **Egress VPC Route Tables**

#### NAT Subnet Route Table (DoD public IP NAT):

```text
0.0.0.0/0          tgw-id  (TGW to DXGW)
```

> NAT gateway SNATs to a public IP from `190.18.0.0/20`.

---

### 🔹 6. **TGW Route Table — Egress VPC Attachment (To DXGW)**

```text
Destination        Attachment
0.0.0.0/0          Direct Connect Gateway
```

> In this case, TGW is **associated** with DXGW and **configured to advertise allowed prefixes** (`190.18.0.0/20`) to DXGW via BGP.

---

### 🔹 7. **DXGW to DoD Router (Private VIF)**

- DXGW uses BGP to announce `190.18.0.0/20` as a valid source prefix to on-premises.
- DoD router sends traffic to `190.18.x.x` destinations via DXGW → TGW → NAT Gateway.

## ✅ Summary of the Flow

| Step | From         | To             | Routed via                          |
|------|--------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1    | EC2-A        | TGW            | Default route in Spoke VPC          |
| 2    | TGW          | Inspection VPC | TGW route table                     |
| 3    | Firewall     | TGW            | Subnet route table after inspection |
| 4    | TGW          | Egress VPC     | TGW route table                     |
| 5    | NAT Gateway  | TGW            | NAT subnet route table              |
| 6    | TGW          | DXGW           | TGW–DXGW association + allowed prefixes |
| 7    | DXGW         | DoD Router     | BGP over private VIF                |
| 8    | DoD Router   | Internet       | NATed IP visible as DoD-assigned    |

## 🔐 Requirements to Make This Work

1. ✅ You **own** the public IP block (`190.18.0.0/20`)
2. ✅ The NAT Gateway resides in a **subnet carved from that block**
3. ✅ TGW is **associated with DXGW**
4. ✅ You **explicitly allow** `190.18.0.0/20` in the **allowed prefixes** during TGW-DXGW association
5. ✅ BGP session is set up on the **Private VIF**

---

Would you like a visual for this updated flow or the JSON for a `tgw-dxgw-association` with allowed prefixes?

You're asking the **exact right questions** — this is one of the most **misunderstood parts** of using **TGW to route NAT’d traffic out via DXGW**.

Let’s carefully walk through how the **Egress VPC Route Table** and **TGW route table** interact when the **NAT Gateway lives in a public DoD-assigned IP subnet** (`190.18.0.0/20`), and the **TGW is associated with a DXGW**.

---

## 🔁 RECAP OF STEP 5: "Egress VPC Route Table ➝ TGW ➝ DXGW"

### You said:
> NAT GW subnet should be `190.18.0.0/20`, so how can the route table show `0.0.0.0/0 ➝ tgw-id`?

✅ You're **correct** to question that. Here's the **correct reasoning and behavior**:

---

## 🧭 NAT Subnet Route Table (Egress VPC)

### NAT Gateway is in a public subnet: `190.18.1.0/24` (part of `190.18.0.0/20`)

It uses its **ENI’s IP address** (from this subnet) to perform SNAT.

But — **where does it send traffic**?

- Normally, it would use an **IGW**
- But in SCCA: ❌ No IGW allowed

### ✅ So instead:
We configure the **NAT subnet's route table** like this:

```text
Destination        Target
0.0.0.0/0          tgw-id
```

> This means: the NAT Gateway **sends internet-bound traffic to the Transit Gateway**, not the IGW.

---

## ❓Wait... shouldn’t traffic go out via VGW or DXGW?

➡ **Yes — and that’s what the TGW will do.**

This is where the **TGW + DXGW association** comes into play.

---

## 🛣 TGW Route Table (for Egress VPC Attachment)

This TGW route table defines what to do **with traffic from the NAT Gateway subnet**:

```text
Destination        Attachment
0.0.0.0/0          Direct Connect Gateway
```

💡 **Important detail:** You can associate a TGW route table with the Egress VPC’s TGW attachment, and tell it:

> “For all outbound traffic (`0.0.0.0/0`), route to the **DXGW**.”

This works because:
- AWS now allows **Transit Gateway associations with DXGW**
- You must **explicitly configure 'allowed prefixes'** (e.g., `190.18.0.0/20`) that will be advertised from TGW to DXGW

---

### 🔄 Routing Chain at this Point

| Component         | Route Table Action                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **NAT subnet RT** | `0.0.0.0/0 ➝ tgw-id` — send SNAT'd packet to TGW         |
| **TGW RT**        | `0.0.0.0/0 ➝ DXGW` — forward all external traffic to DXGW|
| **DXGW**          | Passes packet over private VIF to on-prem or internet   |

---

## 🔧 What Makes This Work

1. **NAT GW has a public IP** from your DoD-owned block (via subnet in `190.18.0.0/20`)
2. The **Egress VPC is attached to the TGW**
3. The **TGW is associated with a DXGW**
4. You’ve configured **TGW-DXGW allowed prefixes** (e.g., `190.18.0.0/20`)
5. **On-prem BGP peer is configured** to accept `190.18.0.0/20` as a routed source

## ✅ TL;DR

| Routing Table          | Key Entry                             | Why?                                          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **NAT subnet RT**      | `0.0.0.0/0 ➝ tgw-id`                   | NAT sends SNAT'd traffic to TGW               |
| **TGW RT (Egress)**    | `0.0.0.0/0 ➝ DXGW`                     | TGW forwards to DXGW                          |
| **TGW–DXGW Association**| Allowed Prefix: `190.18.0.0/20`       | Ensures traffic sourced from DoD IP is valid  |
