Based on the **AWS Prescriptive Guidance for DoD SCCA** (March 2024 edition)  **AWS Network Firewall** can **meet many, but not all, of the SCCA VDSS (Virtual Data Center Security Stack) requirements**. Let’s break it down clearly.

### ✅ **What AWS Network Firewall _Can_ Cover (Fully or Partially)**

| **VDSS Requirement**                                                                 | **Covered?**         | **Details**                                                                                       |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Segmentation of management, user, and data traffic**                               | ✅ Covered           | Achieved via AWS Network Firewall + NACLs + SGs                                                   |
| **Traffic inspection between mission owner VPCs (East/West)**                        | ✅ Covered           | Centralized filtering using AWS Network Firewall with TGW                                         |
| **TLS/SSL inspection with single/dual auth**                                         | ✅ Covered           | TLS decryption supported via AWS Network Firewall with TLS inspection configuration              |
| **Traffic filtering between networks (North/South and East/West)**                  | ✅ Covered           | Centralized through the Inspection VPC using TGW                                                  |
| **Full Packet Capture (FPC) or equivalent capability**                               | ✅ Covered           | Not literal FPC, but Flow Logs + Firewall logs achieve intent                                     |
| **Log/Event capture for cybersecurity analysis and alerting**                        | ✅ Covered           | Via CloudWatch Logs + AWS Network Firewall log destinations + GuardDuty                          |
| **Port/Protocol/Service management**                                                 | ✅ Covered           | Managed via AWS Network Firewall stateful/stateless rule groups                                  |
| **Unauthorized application-layer traffic detection (basic)**                         | ⚠️ *Partially*       | Needs augmentation with WAF or 3rd-party reverse proxy/IPS for application-level behavior         |
| **Malicious activity monitoring (e.g., lateral movement)**                           | ⚠️ *Partially*       | Use GuardDuty + AWS Firewall Manager + Network Firewall + VPC Flow Logs                          |

### ❌ **What AWS Network Firewall _Cannot_ Do Alone**

| **VDSS Requirement**                                                                 | **Missing Service/Functionality**                                                               |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reverse proxy for client access (e.g., authenticated proxy or API gateway)**       | AWS WAF/ALB or 3rd-party (e.g., Squid, HAProxy, or Zscaler)                                      |
| **Detecting application session hijacking**                                          | Requires deeper L7 visibility—often covered by advanced NDR/EDR or 3rd-party agents              |
| **FIPS 140-2 credential management for SSL inspection keys (WAF)**                   | Needs integration with **AWS KMS + Secrets Manager**, but not enforced automatically             |
| **DMZ extension for DoD Internet-Facing Applications (IFAs)**                        | Not built-in; must be architected via public ALB/NLB in a Central Ingress VPC                    |

### 🧩 **Supplementary AWS Services Needed for Full SCCA Compliance**

- **AWS WAF**: For deep HTTP/S rule inspection
- **Amazon GuardDuty**: Threat detection and anomaly-based monitoring
- **AWS KMS + Secrets Manager**: For FIPS 140-2 key management and secure credential storage
- **Amazon CloudWatch + CloudTrail + S3**: For log centralization and secure archival
- **Amazon Inspector**: For VM vulnerability detection (relevant to VDMS, not VDSS directly)

### 🧠 Conclusion

**AWS Network Firewall plays a central role in achieving SCCA VDSS compliance**, especially around network-layer segmentation, inspection, filtering, and logging. However, **it must be paired with other AWS services** to meet the full set of SCCA controls—particularly at the **application layer, reverse proxying, and credential/key management** levels.

> If you're planning an implementation: start with Network Firewall for L3/L4 protections and combine it with WAF, GuardDuty, and logging services for full coverage.
