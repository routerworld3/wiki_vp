1. Network Security and Segmentation:
How will VPC traffic segregation be implemented between the different Mission Owners to meet the VDSS requirement for isolating management, user, and data traffic?

What AWS Network Firewall configuration will be used to enforce segmentation between 100-200 VPCs per Mission Owner while ensuring compliance with the DoD's security requirements?

What measures will be put in place to ensure that VPCs belonging to different Mission Owners are logically isolated and adhere to the minimum necessary access controls?

How will VPCs be configured to prevent unauthorized communication or lateral movement between Mission Owners’ VPCs while allowing necessary inter-VPC traffic through AWS Transit Gateway (TGW)?

2. Traffic Inspection and Filtering:
How will inbound and outbound traffic be inspected for each Mission Owner’s VPC to ensure that they comply with the SCCA’s traffic filtering requirements (East-West, North-South)?

How can AWS Network Firewall be configured to inspect both north-south and east-west traffic in a multi-VPC environment supporting hundreds of mission owners?

What additional layers of inspection (e.g., AWS WAF, GuardDuty) are required to complement AWS Network Firewall for traffic filtering at the application layer for the public-facing workloads?

What methods will be employed for SSL/TLS inspection, especially for internet-facing workloads, and how will these comply with DoD’s cybersecurity policies on encryption?

3. Log Management and Monitoring:
How will VPC Flow Logs be managed and aggregated across multiple VPCs to ensure that all security events are logged and monitored for compliance with SCCA?

What AWS services (e.g., CloudWatch, CloudTrail) will be used to provide centralized logging for all traffic traversing between Mission Owner VPCs and external sources such as DXGW?

What role will AWS GuardDuty play in threat detection across the hundreds of VPCs and Mission Owners’ workloads?

What strategies will be implemented for log retention, archiving, and secure access, especially considering the scale of hundreds of VPCs and mission owners?

4. IP Addressing and Routing Over DXGW:
How will DoD IP space be advertised over DXGW to ensure that public-facing workloads are properly routed from on-premises systems to the appropriate VPCs in the AWS Cloud?

What specific CIDR blocks will be used for public IP workloads, and how will they be incorporated into the VPC route tables and DXGW configuration?

What routing policies will be set up to ensure the correct advertisement of DoD’s IP space via DXGW, especially for internet-bound traffic from public-facing workloads?

How will DoD-specific IP ranges be segmented for public and private workloads, and how will these ranges be advertised via Direct Connect and AWS Transit Gateway?

What network security measures (such as AWS Network Firewall and NAT Gateways) will be employed to secure the outbound internet traffic from public-facing workloads while ensuring compliance with SCCA?

5. High Availability and Redundancy:
How will the architecture be designed to ensure high availability (HA) for public-facing workloads, especially considering the possibility of supporting multiple VPCs and hundreds of Mission Owners?

What strategies will be used to ensure that public IP workloads have resilience built into the VPC design, ensuring that VPCs are fault-tolerant and meet the availability standards of the DoD?

How will Multi-AZ deployments, auto-scaling groups, and Elastic Load Balancers (ALB/NLB) be configured for each Mission Owner's public-facing workloads to comply with SCCA and support large-scale traffic?
