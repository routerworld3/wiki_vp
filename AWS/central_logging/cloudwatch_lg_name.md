Great insight. Designing **CloudWatch Log Group naming conventions** is crucial when using **metadata extraction** and **partitioned storage (like in Firehose → S3)**. The key is balancing:

* 🔍 **Discoverability** (What service/component this is?)
* 🗂 **Partitioning & Filtering** (Efficient for S3 queries like Athena)
* 🔐 **Compliance & Organization-wide standards**
* ⚡️ **Efficiency** (Shorter paths, fewer partitions = faster Athena queries)

---

## ✅ Recommended CloudWatch Log Group Naming Convention

Here's a flexible but standardized naming scheme:

```
/aws/<service>/<resource_id>/<log_type>
```

### 🔄 Optionally add region at the end (if needed):

```
/aws/<service>/<resource_id>/<log_type>/<region>
```

## 📋 Suggested Log Group Names by AWS Service

| AWS Service      | Example Log Group Name                                  | Notes                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| VPC Flow Logs    | `/aws/vpc/vpc-0123456789abcdef/flow`                    | Best for large orgs with >1 VPC per account |
| EC2              | `/aws/ec2/i-0123456789abcdef/syslog`                    | Granular for instance-specific logs         |
| RDS              | `/aws/rds/db-ABC123/postgresql`                         | By DB identifier                            |
| Lambda           | `/aws/lambda/my-function-name`                          | Default by AWS                              |
| WAF              | `/aws/waf/webacl-MyApp/logs`                            | Use custom name if possible                 |
| ELB Access       | `/aws/elb/app-myapp/requests`                           | Helps track traffic per ALB                 |
| CloudTrail       | `/aws/cloudtrail/global` or `/aws/cloudtrail/us-east-1` | Region may be useful                        |
| Route53 Resolver | `/aws/route53/resolver/dns-query-logs`                  | Mostly global logs                          |
| Firewall         | `/aws/firewall/firewall-1/flow`                         | Helps extract service + component           |
| API Gateway      | `/aws/apigateway/my-api-id/access-logs`                 | Include stage if needed                     |
| SSM Session Logs | `/aws/ssm/i-0123456789abcdef/session`                   | Per instance session logs                   |

## 📌 Should You Include AWS Region in Log Group?

### ✅ Include Region If:

* You're aggregating logs **cross-region**
* You need to partition S3 by region
* You plan to **query or segment data per region**

### ❌ Skip Region If:

* Each Kinesis Firehose stream is **region-specific** and you're processing logs in-region
* You want to **reduce partition cardinality** (important for S3/Athena efficiency)

> ✅ **RECOMMENDATION**: Don't embed region in log group. Extract it from `.awsRegion` field in logs (already present in CloudWatch log event JSON), and use it in Firehose dynamic partitioning instead.

---

## 🔁 Example Firehose-Compatible Naming

| Log Group Name             | MetadataExtraction Output                                   |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/aws/vpc/vpc-abc123/flow` | `service: vpc`, `resource_id: vpc-abc123`, `log_type: flow` |
| `/aws/ec2/i-123/syslog`    | `service: ec2`, `resource_id: i-123`, `log_type: syslog`    |

Firehose `MetadataExtractionQuery` could then be updated as:

```jq
{
  accountId:.owner,
  region:.awsRegion,
  service:(.logGroup | capture("^/aws/(?<svc>[^/]+)")?.svc // "unknown"),
  resource_id:(.logGroup | capture("^/aws/[^/]+/(?<rid>[^/]+)")?.rid // "unknown"),
  log_type:(.logGroup | capture("^/aws/[^/]+/[^/]+/(?<type>[^/]+)")?.type // "unknown")
}
```

Then use:

```hcl
prefix = "AWSLogs/!{partitionKeyFromQuery:accountId}/!{partitionKeyFromQuery:region}/!{partitionKeyFromQuery:service}/!{partitionKeyFromQuery:resource_id}/!{partitionKeyFromQuery:log_type}/!{timestamp:yyyy/MM/dd/HH}/"
```

---

## ✅ Summary Recommendations

* ✔ Use `/aws/<service>/<resource_id>/<log_type>` for log groups
* ❌ Avoid hardcoding region in log group name; extract via `.awsRegion`
* 🎯 Make log group names machine-parseable and consistent
* 🧠 Test regex using jq locally or on [jqplay.org](https://jqplay.org)

Let me know if you want a Terraform module to enforce this naming across services, or a script to refactor log groups.
