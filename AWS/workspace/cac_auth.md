# ü™™ AWS WorkSpaces: CAC Authentication (Pre-Session & In-Session)

## üìò Overview

AWS WorkSpaces supports **Common Access Card (CAC)** and **PIV smart card authentication** for both:

- ‚úÖ **Pre-session authentication** (when logging into the WorkSpace)
- ‚úÖ **In-session authentication** (after login, for accessing applications or running commands)

This is especially useful for government or regulated environments that rely on PKI and smart card infrastructure.

---

## üß© CAC Authentication Modes

### ‚úÖ 1. Pre-Session Authentication
- Occurs **before** the WorkSpace session starts.
- Uses **mutual TLS (mTLS)** with **AD Connector** and smart card certs.
- Authenticates against your **on-premises Active Directory**.

### ‚úÖ 2. In-Session Authentication
- Occurs **within** the WorkSpace session.
- Enables use of CAC/PIV for secure login to apps (websites, VPNs, sudo, etc.).
- Requires **smart card redirection** to pass reader input into the session.

## üíª Client Support

| Client | Pre-Session CAC | In-Session CAC (Smart Card Redirection) |
|--------|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Windows WorkSpaces Client (v3.1.1+)** | ‚úÖ Supported | ‚úÖ Supported |
| **macOS WorkSpaces Client (v3.1.5+)** | ‚úÖ Supported | ‚úÖ Supported |
| **Web Browser Client** | ‚ùå Not supported | ‚ùå Not supported |
| **Linux Client** | ‚ùå Not supported | ‚ùå Not supported |

> ‚úÖ **Only the Windows/macOS native clients support CAC features.**

---

## üåç Region Availability

| Mode | Regions |
|------|---------|
| **Pre-Session CAC** | Supported in:  
US East (N. Virginia),  
US West (Oregon),  
GovCloud (US-East & West),  
Europe (Ireland),  
Asia Pacific (Tokyo, Sydney) |
| **In-Session CAC** | Available in **all Regions where DCV protocol is supported** |

---

## üìú Requirements

### üîó Directory

- **AD Connector** (Required for Pre-session CAC)
  - Must support **mutual TLS**
  - Requires **Kerberos Constrained Delegation (KCD)**
- On-prem Active Directory must issue certs with:
  - `UPN` in **subjectAltName**
  - EKUs: `Client Authentication` and `Smart Card Logon`
  - OCSP enabled for revocation checking

> ‚ùó You cannot enable both pre-session CAC and password sign-in on the same AD Connector.

---

## üõ† Configuration Overview

### For Pre-Session CAC:
- AD Connector must be configured with **mTLS**
- WorkSpaces must be domain-joined to that AD
- WorkSpaces GPO must enable smart card login & redirection
- Windows Lock Screen Detection should be enabled (to trigger re-auth)

### For In-Session CAC:
- Ensure **smart card redirection** is enabled via GPO
- CAC reader and middleware (like ActivClient) installed on user endpoint
- Optional: Configure Firefox to use PKCS#11 module (OpenSC)

---

## üîê Ports and Protocols for CAC

### ‚úÖ Core Protocol Support

| Protocol | Ports | Used For |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **WSP (WorkSpaces Streaming Protocol)** | `TCP 4195`, `UDP 50002-50003` | ‚úî Required for smart card redirection (in-session CAC) |
| **PCoIP (older protocol)** | `TCP/UDP 4172` | ‚ùå Not recommended for CAC ‚Äî limited support |
| **HTTPS** | `TCP 443` | Used for login, control channel, mTLS auth with AD |

> ‚úÖ **Use WSP for full CAC support** ‚Äî both for pre-session and in-session use.

---

## üîç Summary of Protocol Needs

| CAC Type | Protocol | Required Ports |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| Pre-Session CAC | **HTTPS + mTLS** | `TCP 443` (auth via AD Connector) |
| In-Session CAC | **WSP + Smart Card Redirection** | `TCP 4195`, `UDP 50002-50003`, plus `TCP 443` |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Only **one smart card** per session is supported.
- **Web clients are not supported** for CAC.
- **Ubuntu WorkSpaces** do not support smart cards.
- Only **CAC and PIV** cards are officially supported.
- **In-session CAC** doesn't strictly require OCSP, but it's recommended.

---

## üß™ Testing & Troubleshooting Tips

- Use `pklogin_finder` (Linux) to map certs ‚Üí users
- Enable debug logs for `pam_pkcs11` and `pam_krb5`
- On Windows, use `certutil` to verify mTLS cert trust chains
- In Firefox, load PKCS#11 module manually or via GPO (`policies.json`)
- Watch out for multiple matching certificates on CAC

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

| Task | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| Choose Protocol | ‚úÖ Use **WSP** |
| Client Platform | ‚úÖ Use **Windows/macOS clients only** |
| Directory | ‚úÖ Use **AD Connector with mTLS + OCSP** |
| Certificate Mapping | ‚úÖ Ensure UPN in SAN and correct EKUs |
| Ports | ‚úÖ Allow `443`, `4195`, `50002-50003` |
| GPO Settings | ‚úÖ Enable smart card login + redirection |
