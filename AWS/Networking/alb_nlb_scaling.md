 if you are allocating a **/26 subnet per AZ** (which gives you 64 IPs total, 59 usable after AWS reserves 5), we can give you a realistic estimate of how many **ALBs + NLBs** you can fit **per AZ**, based on their ENI/IP usage.

---

## üì¶ IP Availability in `/26` Subnet

| Subnet Size | Total IPs | Reserved by AWS | Usable IPs    |
| ----------- | --------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| `/26`       | 64        | 5               | **59 usable** |

---

## üß† ENI/IP Usage per Load Balancer (per AZ)

| Load Balancer Type | ENIs/IPs Used (Min) | ENIs/IPs Used (Scaling) |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **ALB**            | 1                   | 10‚Äì30 (avg \~20)        |
| **NLB**            | 1                   | 1‚Äì2 (rarely scales)     |

## ‚úÖ Scenario: Fitting ALBs + NLBs in 59 IPs (per AZ)

Let‚Äôs try different mixes:

---

### üßÆ Case 1: Conservative (ALBs can scale to 20 ENIs)

* Each ALB = \~20 IPs
* Each NLB = 1 IP

#### üí° Max combinations:

| Count of ALBs | Max NLBs (remaining IPs) | Total IPs |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | --------- |
| 2 ALBs        | (59 - 40) = 19 NLBs      | 58        |
| 1 ALB         | 39 NLBs                  | 58        |
| 0 ALB         | 59 NLBs                  | 59        |

---

### üßÆ Case 2: Light Load (ALBs scale to 10 ENIs)

* Each ALB = \~10 IPs

| Count of ALBs | Max NLBs | Total IPs |
| ------------- | -------- | --------- |
| 4 ALBs        | 19 NLBs  | 59        |
| 5 ALBs        | 9 NLBs   | 59        |

---

### üßÆ Case 3: Static (ALBs never scale)

* Each ALB = 1 IP
* **Only valid for test or low-load scenarios**

| ALBs | NLBs | Total |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
| 20   | 39   | 59    |
| 30   | 29   | 59    |
| 59   | 0    | 59    |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Not safe in production** ‚Äî ALBs can scale unpredictably.

---

## ‚úÖ Practical Safe Limits (per AZ `/26`)

| LB Type          | Max Safe Count                      |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **ALB (scaled)** | 2‚Äì3                                 |
| **NLB**          | 30‚Äì40                               |
| **Mix**          | 1 ALB + 39 NLBs<br>2 ALBs + 19 NLBs |

---

## üí° Recommendation

* Plan **1‚Äì2 ALBs per AZ max**, assuming they may scale
* Use remaining capacity for NLBs, which are more IP-efficient
* Track ENI/IP usage via CloudWatch metrics and VPC subnet viewer
