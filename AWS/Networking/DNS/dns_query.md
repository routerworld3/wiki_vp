# DNS Query

---

## Step-by-Step DNS Query Explanation (Real-Life Scenario)

**Scenario:**  
A user types `example.com` into their browser. The browser needs the IP address of `example.com` to access the website.

The DNS query process happens  as follows:

### Step 1: User Request (Browser)

- A user opens their browser and types:

  ```
  example.com
  ```

- The user's computer checks its local DNS cache first (to see if it already knows the IP).

## DNS Server Roles  Defined

**There are four main DNS servers involved in this process:**

| DNS Server Type  | Purpose ( Explained)                        |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Root DNS Server  | Points to TLD (.com, .org, .net) authoritative servers |
| TLD DNS Server   | Points to authoritative name servers for the domain (`.com` DNS) |
| Authoritative DNS Server | Holds actual DNS records (Route 53 in AWS)    |
| Recursive DNS Server | Queries DNS hierarchy on your behalf (usually your ISP, Google DNS 8.8.8.8, Cloudflare DNS 1.1.1.1, etc.) |

## ASCII Diagram (Logical Flow  Explained)

Below is the simplified logical flow when querying `example.com`:

```
+-------------------------+
| User Types "example.com" |
+-----------+-------------+
            │
            ▼
+-------------------------------------+
| Step 1: User’s computer DNS cache   |
| (Local resolver cache check)        |
+--------------------------------------+
           │ Misses Cache (Doesn't know)
           ▼
+-------------------------------------------+
| Step 2: Recursive DNS Server (ISP, 8.8.8.8)|
+----------------------+--------------------+
                       │ (Asks Root DNS: "Who manages .com?")
                       ▼
+----------------------+-----------------------+
| Step 3: Root DNS Server (Top-level authority)|
+----------------------------------------------+
                       │ Response: ".com managed by Verisign DNS"
                       ▼
+---------------------------------------+
| Step 4: .com TLD DNS Server            |
+----------------------+-----------------+
                       │ (Responds: "Route53 NS servers manage example.com")
                       ▼
+----------------------+---------------------------------------+
| Step 4: Authoritative DNS Server (AWS Route 53 for example.com) |
+----------------------+---------------------------------------+
                       │ (Returns A/ALIAS record with IP: 1.2.3.4)
                       ▼
+----------------------+-----------------------+
| Step 5: Recursive DNS receives IP "1.2.3.4"  |
+----------------------------------------------+
                       │ (Sends response back to user)
                       ▼
+----------------------+---------------------+
| User’s browser receives final IP address   |
| and connects directly to server IP: 1.2.3.4 |
+--------------------------------------------+

## Each step explained logically and :

- **Step 1 (Local Cache):**  
  User’s device (PC/phone) checks its local DNS cache first. If not found, it proceeds to the next step.

- **Step 2 (Recursive DNS Server):**  
  The user's recursive DNS server (your ISP, Google DNS `8.8.8.8`, or Cloudflare `1.1.1.1`) starts the DNS lookup process.

- **Step 3 (Root DNS Server):**  
  The recursive DNS asks the **Root DNS Server** about the `.com` domain:
  ```

  "Who manages .com?"

  ```
  Root DNS points  to the authoritative DNS servers for `.com`.

- **Step 4 (TLD DNS Server):**  
  Recursive DNS then queries the **TLD DNS (.com)** server :
  ```

  "Who manages example.com?"

  ```
  The TLD DNS points to AWS Route 53 NS servers :
  ```

  "AWS Route53 DNS manages example.com"

  ```

- **Step 5 (Authoritative DNS Server):**  
  Finally, the recursive DNS queries AWS Route 53 for the IP address of `example.com`. AWS Route 53 (the authoritative DNS) responds:
  ```

  "example.com → 1.2.3.4"

  ```
- Recursive DNS returns the IP (1.2.3.4) back to the user's device.

- The user’s browser  connects directly to the web server IP address.

## Final Real-life Example DNS Query Flow ( Illustrated):

**User → ISP DNS (Recursive) → Root DNS → .com DNS (TLD) → AWS Route53 (Authoritative DNS)**  
**→ IP Address (returned  back)**

The user's browser now knows  where to go and directly accesses your website’s IP.

---

## Summary ( explained):

- **Local DNS Cache** (user’s device) checks first.
- **Recursive DNS Server** queries authoritative DNS hierarchy (Root → TLD → Domain authority).
- **Authoritative DNS server (AWS Route 53)** provides the final answer  (IP address).
- The user can now connect directly to your web server using this IP.

I hope this  explains DNS query flow with real-life examples!
