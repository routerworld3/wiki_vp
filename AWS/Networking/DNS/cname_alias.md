# Route53 CNAME and Alias

---

## **Explained: Difference between AWS Route 53 CNAME and Alias Records**

### First, an Easy Real-Life Analogy

Think of your domain (`example.com`) as your home:

- **Root (Apex) Domain (`example.com`)** is your main home address (`123 Main Street`).
- **Subdomains (`blog.example.com`, `shop.example.com`)** are rooms or apartments within your home (`Apartment A, 123 Main Street`).

---

## **Whatâ€™s a CNAME Record? ( Explained)**

**Definition:**
A **CNAME record** points a domain or subdomain **to another domain name**.

### **Real-Life Use Case:**

- Your websiteâ€™s blog (`blog.example.com`) is hosted externally at Medium.com.
- Medium provides you with a domain name like:

  ```
  mycompany.medium.com
  ```

- You set up a CNAME record:

  ```
  blog.example.com â†’ mycompany.medium.com
  ```

- Now, anyone accessing `blog.example.com` will automatically be redirected to Medium.

### Explained DNS Flow

```
User requests: blog.example.com
  â””â†’ DNS resolves via Route 53 CNAME to "mycompany.medium.com"
            â””â”€ Resolves further to Mediumâ€™s IP
```

**This is valid and widely used.**

---

## **Why can't you use CNAME at the Root (Apex) domain?**

- According to the DNS standard (RFC 1034/1035), a CNAME record **cannot coexist with other DNS records** like `SOA`, `NS`, or `MX`.
- Your root domain (`example.com`) must have essential records (`NS`, `SOA`).
- A **CNAME record** would replace these essential DNS records, causing the domain to break.

**Thus, the DNS standard explicitly prohibits CNAME at root domains.**

---

## **AWS Alias Record ( Explained Solution)**

AWS Route53 created **Alias records** specifically to solve this limitation:

- **Alias records** can directly point the **root domain** to AWS resources (ELB, CloudFront, API Gateway, S3) without breaking DNS standards.
- Alias records directly resolve internally to IP addresses without additional DNS lookups.

### Real-Life Example

You have your root domain pointing to an AWS Load Balancer:

```
example.com â†’ ALIAS â†’ my-loadbalancer-123.region.elb.amazonaws.com
```

This is fully valid and efficient.

## **Explained Practical Scenarios:**

Here are common real-life scenarios  explained:

| Scenario (Real-Life)                  | DNS Record Type    | Example Configuration  Explained        | Is it allowed? |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Root domain to AWS ELB**            | **Alias Record**   | `example.com â†’ myalb.elb.amazonaws.com`        | âœ… Yes         |
| **Subdomain to external service**     | **CNAME Record**   | `blog.example.com â†’ medium.com`                | âœ… Yes         |
| **Root domain to external domain**    | **CNAME Record**   | `example.com â†’ anotherdomain.net`              | ðŸš« **No** (root restriction) |
| **Subdomain to external service**     | **CNAME Record**   | `shop.example.com â†’ myshop.shopify.com`        | âœ… **Yes** (allowed ) |

---

## **Examples of Allowed DNS Records ( Demonstrated):**

- **Alias Record (root):**

```
example.com â†’ ALIAS â†’ d123.cloudfront.net
```

- **CNAME record (subdomain):**

```
blog.example.com â†’ mycompany.medium.com
```

- **CNAME across different TLD (allowed )**:

```
blog.example.com â†’ anotherdomain.net
```

---

## **Explained Final Clarification:**

- **CNAME Record**:
  - Standard DNS record.
  - **ONLY points to other domain names.**
  - **Cannot** be used at root (apex) domains.

- **Alias Record (AWS-specific)**:
  - Points directly to AWS-managed services (CloudFront, ELB, API Gateway, S3).
  - Can be used safely at apex/root domains.
  - No extra DNS lookup, faster resolution.

---

## **Conclusion ( and Logically Explained):**

- CNAME records **cannot be at the root domain** due to DNS standards.
- AWS Alias records provide a clean solution for root domain DNS management.
- Subdomains can  use either Alias or CNAME, depending on the scenario.

This real-life clarification  outlines exactly when to use a **CNAME** versus an **Alias record**, and specifically why a **CNAME** cannot be used at the root (apex) domain.
