# RDS Performance Overview

---

## üìå **Logical Flow of Performance Bottlenecks in AWS RDS:**

Performance issues in AWS RDS databases typically occur in three primary areas:

- **Instance (CPU/Memory)**  
- **Storage (IOPS & Throughput)**  
- **Network (Throughput/Latency)**

Let's explore each logically and clearly:

---

## ‚úÖ **1. Instance Size (CPU/Memory Bottleneck):**

### **When is Instance Size the bottleneck?**

- High **CPU utilization** (above 70-80% consistently).
- Insufficient memory causing frequent swapping or cache misses:
  - Check for Oracle DB "SGA or PGA memory waits".
- Performance degradation during peak application load or complex queries.

### **Indicators:**

- High CPU metrics in **CloudWatch** or Oracle‚Äôs performance metrics.
- High `CPUWait`, `%idle` is low, indicating CPU saturation.
- Increased latency due to lack of memory (frequent disk reads).

### **Resolution:**

- Upgrade the RDS instance to a larger class with more **vCPUs and memory**.

---

## ‚úÖ **2. Storage (IOPS & Throughput Bottleneck):**

AWS RDS storage bottlenecks depend on two factors:

- **Storage Type (gp2 vs gp3)**:  
  - General Purpose SSD (**gp2**) has performance tied to volume size.
  - General Purpose SSD (**gp3**) independently scales IOPS and throughput.

- **Instance-level Storage Limits** (each instance type has a maximum storage throughput and IOPS limit).

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **gp2 Storage: How IOPS & Throughput Work**

- **Baseline performance** = **3 IOPS per GB** of provisioned storage.
- Minimum: **100 IOPS**, Maximum: **16,000 IOPS**
- IOPS scales linearly with storage size:
  - Example: 1TB (1024 GB) gp2 = **3,072 baseline IOPS**.
- Throughput scales up to **250 MiB/s** at large volumes.

### **When is gp2 the bottleneck?**

- Small gp2 volume (<1TB) delivering insufficient baseline IOPS.
- Frequent "burst balance" exhaustion for small gp2 volumes (less than ~100GB).

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **gp3 Storage: How IOPS & Throughput Work**

- **gp3** allows **independent scaling** of IOPS and throughput, regardless of size.
- Default: **3,000 IOPS**, **125 MiB/s throughput**.
- You can scale:
  - Up to **16,000 IOPS**
  - Up to **1,000 MiB/s throughput** (depending on the RDS instance type).

### **When is gp3 the bottleneck?**

- Not appropriately provisioned enough IOPS/throughput.
- If your workload demands exceed provisioned IOPS, you'll encounter high disk latency, increased queue depth, and performance issues.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Instance-Level Storage Limits:**

AWS RDS instances have predefined maximum IOPS and throughput limits, regardless of provisioned storage type or size.

**Example:**  

- An instance like **db.m5.large** has lower limits compared to **db.r5.4xlarge**.
- Even if you provision high IOPS (e.g., 16,000 IOPS), the **instance limit can restrict actual throughput**.

**Important:**  

- Always verify instance-level limits in [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Storage.html#gp2-storage) before provisioning very high IOPS.

---

## ‚úÖ **3. Network Bottleneck:**

Each RDS instance class has defined **network bandwidth** limits. Larger instances provide higher network performance.

### **When is Network the bottleneck?**

- Heavy data-transfer workloads (large SELECTs, batch inserts, replication traffic).
- **CloudWatch network metrics** consistently at or near maximum capacity.
- Frequent latency or timeout issues during heavy DB interactions.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Logical Flow: Diagnosing the Bottleneck:**

Here's how to logically diagnose performance issues clearly:

| Performance Symptom                  | Likely Bottleneck                   | Recommended Action                        |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| High CPU usage, Memory shortage      | **Instance Size** (CPU/Memory)      | Upgrade Instance Type (larger instance)   |
| High Disk Queue Depth, Disk Latency  | **Storage (IOPS/Throughput)**       | Increase IOPS (gp3), larger gp2 volume    |
| Reached Max instance storage limits  | **Instance storage limit**          | Upgrade instance type with higher limits  |
| Consistently high network throughput | **Network** (instance size related) | Upgrade to instance with higher bandwidth |

---

## üö¶ **Step-by-step to pinpoint bottleneck logically:**

### **Step 1: Check CPU & Memory Usage**

- AWS CloudWatch Metrics: `CPUUtilization`, `FreeableMemory`
- Oracle Metrics: `AWR Reports`, CPU & Memory wait events

### **Step 2: Check Storage Performance**

- CloudWatch Metrics:  
  - `DiskQueueDepth`, `ReadLatency`, `WriteLatency`
  - Check if IOPS reach provisioned IOPS limit frequently.
- Oracle Metrics:  
  - `AWR Reports`, `I/O waits` (high wait events indicate storage issues)

### **Step 3: Check Instance-level Limits**

- Confirm your current instance type storage limits:
  - [AWS RDS Instance Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html#Concepts.DBInstanceClass.Performance)

### **Step 4: Check Network Limits**

- AWS CloudWatch Network Metrics:  
  - `NetworkTransmitThroughput`, `NetworkReceiveThroughput`
- Compare against published limits for your instance type.

---

## üìù **Logical Summary (example scenario):**

- Suppose you provision **gp3 storage with high IOPS (10,000)** on a **small instance type (db.m5.large)**.
  - Even though storage is provisioned for 10,000 IOPS, **the instance-level limit is around 4,750 IOPS** (for db.m5.large).
  - Therefore, **your bottleneck is instance-level storage throughput, not storage provisioning**.

- If you see high CPU usage consistently:
  - **Bottleneck is instance size**, requiring CPU/memory upgrade.

- High Disk Queue & Latency, yet low CPU usage and network:
  - **Storage provisioning** (IOPS/throughput) is the bottleneck.

---

## ‚úÖ **How to Fix Each Bottleneck (Summary):**

- **Instance bottleneck:**  
  ‚úÖ Upgrade to larger instance type.

- **Storage bottleneck (gp2):**  
  ‚úÖ Increase storage volume size or switch to gp3.

- **Storage bottleneck (gp3):**  
  ‚úÖ Provision more IOPS/throughput.

- **Instance-level storage limit bottleneck:**  
  ‚úÖ Upgrade instance to one with higher storage IOPS/throughput limits.

- **Network bottleneck:**  
  ‚úÖ Upgrade to instance type with higher network bandwidth.

---

## üóÉÔ∏è **Logical Conclusion:**

- Always evaluate **instance metrics, storage metrics, and network metrics** in tandem.
- Clearly identify if performance constraints are due to insufficient **CPU, memory, storage, or network**.
- Remember, even if storage IOPS provisioned is high, **instance limits can still restrict actual performance**.

Using this logical evaluation, you can quickly pinpoint the root cause and implement the right solution to remove the bottleneck in your AWS RDS Oracle database environment.

Here's a clear and logical explanation of **IOPS and Throughput** and how **gp3 storage** allows scaling them independently, as well as how instance size impacts these parameters:

---

## ‚úÖ **Understanding IOPS vs. Throughput (Clearly Explained)**

### 1. **IOPS (Input/Output Operations per Second)**

- **Definition**: The number of distinct read/write operations the disk/storage can perform **per second**.
- **Typical Use Case**: Transactional workloads (OLTP databases like Oracle) where operations are small and frequent.

**Example**:  

- 1 IOPS = 1 single read or write request per second.  
- 10,000 IOPS means the disk can handle **10,000 small individual read/write operations per second**.

---

### 2. **Throughput (MB/s or MiB/s)**

- **Definition**: The **amount of data** the storage can transfer per second, measured typically in MB/s (Megabytes per second) or MiB/s.
- **Typical Use Case**: Large sequential data transfer or batch operations (backups, reporting queries).

**Example**:  

- 250 MiB/s throughput means the disk can transfer **250 MiB of data per second**.

---

## üö¶ **How Are Throughput and IOPS Related? (Logical Relationship)**

They are related by the following formula:

```
Throughput (MB/s) = (IOPS √ó IO size) √∑ 1024
```

**Example:**

- If your workload has an average **IO size** of 8 KB (typical for databases):
  - At 10,000 IOPS:

  ```
  Throughput = (10,000 √ó 8 KB) √∑ 1024 ‚âà 78 MB/s
  ```

- At the same 10,000 IOPS with a larger IO size of 64 KB (batch workloads):

  ```
  Throughput = (10,000 √ó 64 KB) √∑ 1024 ‚âà 625 MB/s
  ```

**Logical insight**:  

- Smaller IO size (typical database transactions) will be constrained by **IOPS**.
- Larger IO size (large batch transfers) will be constrained by **Throughput**.

---

## ‚úÖ **How AWS gp3 Allows Independent Scaling of IOPS & Throughput**

AWS gp3 storage separates **capacity**, **IOPS**, and **throughput**:

| Feature          | gp2 (old)                      | gp3 (new)                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| IOPS             | Fixed at 3 IOPS/GB             | Independent scaling (3,000‚Äì16,000) |
| Throughput       | Fixed (depends on size)        | Independent scaling (125‚Äì1,000 MiB/s) |
| Volume size      | Dictates IOPS/Throughput       | Does **not** dictate IOPS/Throughput |

**Example with gp3:**

- You can provision a **100 GB gp3 volume**:
  - **Default:** 3,000 IOPS and 125 MiB/s.
  - **Customizable:** Scale independently:
    - **IOPS:** up to 16,000.
    - **Throughput:** up to 1,000 MiB/s.
- Unlike gp2, increasing IOPS or throughput on gp3 **does not require increasing volume size**.

---

## ‚úÖ **Why Instance Size Still Matters (Logical Explanation)**

Even if gp3 allows independent scaling, **AWS RDS instance types have built-in storage limits**:

- **Maximum IOPS:**  
  Each instance type (e.g., db.m5.large, db.r5.4xlarge) has a documented maximum IOPS limit.
- **Maximum Throughput:**  
  Each instance type has a maximum storage throughput (MB/s) it can handle.

**Example Limits (simplified):**

| Instance Type | Max IOPS Supported | Max Throughput (MiB/s) |
|---------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| db.m5.large   | ~4,750 IOPS        | ~475 MiB/s             |
| db.m5.xlarge  | ~9,500 IOPS        | ~950 MiB/s             |
| db.r5.4xlarge | 40,000+ IOPS       | 1,000+ MiB/s           |

**Logical implication:**

- Even if you provision a gp3 volume with **16,000 IOPS and 1,000 MiB/s**, a small instance like **db.m5.large** still **cannot use the full capacity** due to the instance's internal limits.
- This creates a "bottleneck" at the instance level, not at the storage level.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Logical Example to Demonstrate Bottlenecks Clearly:**

| Setup                                | Provisioned IOPS | Instance Limit | Actual IOPS available |
|--------------------------------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| db.m5.large + gp3 (16,000 IOPS)      | 16,000           | ~4,750         | **4,750 (bottleneck)** |
| db.r5.4xlarge + gp3 (16,000 IOPS)    | 16,000           | ~40,000        | **16,000 (full)**     |

Clearly, instance size directly impacts storage performance, no matter how high you scale gp3 storage.

---

## üìå **Logical Steps to Determine Which to Upgrade (Instance or Storage):**

**Step 1: Check CloudWatch metrics**

- Disk latency high, queue depth high? ‚Üí IOPS/Throughput bottleneck.
- CPU/Memory high? ‚Üí Instance bottleneck.

**Step 2: Check provisioned IOPS vs. instance type limits**

- Provisioned IOPS exceeding instance limit? ‚Üí Upgrade instance size.

**Step 3: Check average IO Size of workload**

- Small IO size, low throughput used ‚Üí Increase IOPS.
- Large IO size, high throughput demands ‚Üí Increase Throughput (MiB/s).

---

## üìù **Summary (Clearly & Logically):**

- **gp3 storage** lets you scale IOPS and throughput independently, unlike gp2.
- **IOPS** measures how many operations you can perform per second, ideal for **transactional workloads**.
- **Throughput** measures how much data you can transfer per second, ideal for **batch/large transfer workloads**.
- **Instance size** imposes its own limits on storage IOPS and throughput, potentially becoming the bottleneck.

To fix a bottleneck clearly:

- If hitting the instance-level limit ‚Üí **upgrade instance size**.
- If not hitting instance limit but hitting storage limits ‚Üí **scale gp3 IOPS or Throughput independently**.

---

This logical approach clearly explains the relationship between throughput, IOPS, gp3 flexibility, and instance size limitations in AWS RDS Oracle environments.
