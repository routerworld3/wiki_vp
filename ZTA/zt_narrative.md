the “Zero Trust means no IP restrictions” narrative is oversimplified.
In practice, IP address is still a **valid signal**, but in Zero Trust it’s just **one of many attributes** used to make an access decision.

### Why IP restrictions aren’t “going away”

* In older perimeter models, IP allowlists were often the *primary* control.
* In Zero Trust, they lose their **single-point-of-truth** status, but they remain useful as an *additional conditional factor*.
* IP can help reduce attack surface and block obviously invalid requests (e.g., geolocation-based restrictions, corporate VPN ranges), even if identity and device posture are the primary gates.

### How IP fits into Zero Trust

Zero Trust evaluates **multiple attributes** at access time, for every request:

* **Identity** – Who is requesting access (user/service account)
* **Device posture** – Compliance status, OS version, MDM enrollment, etc.
* **Network context** – Source IP, ASN, geolocation, VPN use
* **Time-based context** – Time of day, day of week, unusual activity patterns
* **Application sensitivity** – Criticality and data classification of the resource
* **Behavioral anomalies** – User’s normal patterns vs. current activity

Instead of *“allow IP = allow access”*, Zero Trust uses *“IP + identity + device + time + risk score = decision”*.

### Practical Example: Stricter Access Policy

You could have a policy like:

* Allow access **only if**:

  1. User identity is verified via SSO + MFA
  2. Device is compliant (corporate-managed + encrypted + AV enabled)
  3. Request originates from a **known IP range** or **trusted geolocation**
  4. Request is within **business hours** for that user’s region
  5. Risk score is below threshold

Here, IP is not the *sole* gatekeeper — but it still helps reduce the attack surface and false positives.

If you want, I can diagram how IP fits into a **Zero Trust decision flow** so it’s clear it’s an attribute, not a perimeter wall. That visual usually makes it click for stakeholders.
