# Traffic Flow

---

## **Key F5 Concepts**

### **1. Virtual IP (VIP)**

- **VIP:** Represents an IP that clients use to access services.
- **Traffic Example:**  

  ```
  VIP (External F5): 198.51.100.10:443  
  VIP (Internal F5): 10.2.2.20:443  
  ```

### **2. Virtual Server**

- A **Virtual Server** listens on a VIP and defines how to process traffic.
- **Example Configuration:**
  - **External F5 Virtual Server:**  
    - **VIP:** `198.51.100.10:443`  
    - **Protocol:** HTTPS  
    - **Backend Pool:** Internal F5 VIP (`10.2.2.20:443`)  

  - **Internal F5 Virtual Server:**  
    - **VIP:** `10.2.2.20:443`  
    - **Backend Pool:** EC2 Instances (`10.3.3.100:443`)  

### **3. TLS Profile**

- **Client SSL Profile (External F5):** Handles decryption of HTTPS traffic from users.  
- **Server SSL Profile (Internal F5):** Re-encrypts traffic to EC2 instances if necessary.

**Traffic Flow with TLS:**  

- **User:** Sends HTTPS to External F5.  
- **External F5:** Decrypts and forwards to Internal F5.  
- **Internal F5:** Optionally re-encrypts and sends to EC2.

### **4. Web Application Firewall (WAF)**

- Protects applications by inspecting traffic for security threats (SQLi, XSS, etc.).
- Can be applied at the **External F5** to mitigate public-facing attacks.

### **5. SNAT (Source Network Address Translation)**

- **SNAT on Internal F5** ensures EC2 instances respond to traffic via the F5.
- **Why Use SNAT?**  
  - Ensures responses go back through the F5 (avoids asymmetric routing).
- **Example:**  
  - Original Source IP (`203.0.113.25`) becomes Internal F5 Self IP (`10.2.2.10`).

## **Traffic Scenarios: Break & Inspect vs. No Break**

1. **Break & Inspect:**
   - **TLS Decryption:** F5 decrypts traffic for inspection (e.g., WAF analysis).
   - **Re-encrypts:** After inspection, F5 re-encrypts traffic to the backend (EC2).

2. **No Break & Inspect:**
   - **TLS Passthrough:** F5 forwards encrypted traffic to backend servers without decryption.
   - **Inspection Limitations:** No deep inspection of encrypted traffic.

### **Summary of Flow:**

```
User [Public IP]  
   ↓  
External F5 VIP [198.51.100.10:443] (TLS Offload, WAF)  
   ↓  
Internal F5 VIP [10.2.2.20:443] (SNAT, Optional TLS Re-encrypt)  
   ↓  
EC2 Private IP [10.3.3.100:443]
```

This setup provides secure and efficient handling of traffic with load balancing, TLS offloading, WAF protection, and traffic flow control through SNAT.

Here's an improved version that incorporates where **Break & Inspect** should occur and summarizes the flow for both scenarios, including **SNAT** details.

## **F5 Concepts with Traffic Flow, IP Packet Headers, and Break & Inspect**

Your architecture involves an **External F5** (public-facing) and an **Internal F5** (handling traffic to private subnets). Here's a detailed breakdown of F5 concepts, traffic flow, and where **Break & Inspect** should occur.

### **Traffic Flow Diagram**

```
User =====> External F5 VIP (Public IP) =====> Internal F5 VIP =====> EC2 or AWS ELB (Private IP)
```

---

### **Where Break & Inspect Should Occur**

1. **External F5 (Recommended for Public Traffic):**
   - Perform **Break & Inspect** (SSL decryption and inspection) on the **External F5**.
   - This allows you to analyze traffic for malicious payloads using WAF before it enters the internal network.

2. **Internal F5 (Optional for Encrypted Traffic to Backend):**
   - If backend communication requires inspection, perform **Break & Inspect** on the **Internal F5**.
   - This helps in cases where encrypted traffic to the backend needs deep inspection or monitoring.

---

### **Traffic Scenarios**

1. **Break & Inspect Scenario (Recommended)**  
   - SSL/TLS traffic is decrypted on the F5 for inspection and optionally re-encrypted before forwarding.

2. **No Break & Inspect Scenario**  
   - SSL/TLS traffic is passed through to the backend without decryption.

## **Detailed Flow with IP Packet Headers and SNAT**

### **1. Break & Inspect Scenario**

#### **Flow:**

```
User [Public IP]  
   ↓  
External F5 VIP [198.51.100.10:443] (Break & Inspect: TLS Decrypt, WAF, SNAT)  
   ↓  
Internal F5 VIP [10.2.2.20:443] (Optional TLS Re-encrypt, SNAT)  
   ↓  
EC2 Private IP [10.3.3.100:443]
```

#### **IP Packet Headers:**

1. **User to External F5:**  
   - **Source IP:** `203.0.113.25` (User's Public IP)  
   - **Destination IP:** `198.51.100.10` (External F5 VIP)

2. **External F5 to Internal F5 (After SNAT):**  
   - **Source IP:** `10.1.1.10` (External F5 Self IP)  
   - **Destination IP:** `10.2.2.20` (Internal F5 VIP)

3. **Internal F5 to EC2 (After SNAT):**  
   - **Source IP:** `10.2.2.10` (Internal F5 Self IP)  
   - **Destination IP:** `10.3.3.100` (EC2 Private IP)

---

### **2. No Break & Inspect Scenario**

#### **Flow:**

```
User [Public IP]  
   ↓  
External F5 VIP [198.51.100.10:443] (TLS Passthrough, SNAT)  
   ↓  
Internal F5 VIP [10.2.2.20:443] (TLS Passthrough, SNAT)  
   ↓  
EC2 Private IP [10.3.3.100:443]
```

#### **IP Packet Headers:**

1. **User to External F5:**  
   - **Source IP:** `203.0.113.25` (User's Public IP)  
   - **Destination IP:** `198.51.100.10` (External F5 VIP)

2. **External F5 to Internal F5 (After SNAT):**  
   - **Source IP:** `10.1.1.10` (External F5 Self IP)  
   - **Destination IP:** `10.2.2.20` (Internal F5 VIP)

3. **Internal F5 to EC2 (After SNAT):**  
   - **Source IP:** `10.2.2.10` (Internal F5 Self IP)  
   - **Destination IP:** `10.3.3.100` (EC2 Private IP)

## **Summary of Flow and Scenarios**

### **Break & Inspect Scenario:**

1. **External F5** decrypts traffic, inspects it (e.g., WAF), and applies **SNAT** to forward traffic to the **Internal F5**.
2. **Internal F5** optionally re-encrypts traffic and applies **SNAT** to forward traffic to **EC2**.
3. Traffic is fully inspected before reaching the backend servers.

### **No Break & Inspect Scenario:**

1. **External F5** forwards encrypted traffic directly to the **Internal F5** (TLS passthrough).
2. **Internal F5** forwards encrypted traffic to **EC2** without decryption.
3. This method is simpler but doesn't allow for deep inspection of encrypted traffic.

### **Key Points:**

- **SNAT** ensures responses return through the F5, avoiding asymmetric routing.
- **Break & Inspect** on the **External F5** is best for securing public-facing traffic.
- Use **Internal F5 Break & Inspect** when backend traffic also needs inspection.
