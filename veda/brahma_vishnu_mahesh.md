Yes ‚Äî the story you‚Äôre referring to is a profound and symbolic tale from **Hindu cosmology**, found in **the Shiva Purana** and **Linga Purana**, involving **Brahma** and **Vishnu** trying to discover the origin of **a mysterious pillar of light**, which is ultimately revealed to be **Lord Shiva** in the form of an infinite **li·πÖga** (symbolic pillar).

This story not only illustrates the **limits of knowledge and ego**, but also strongly resembles philosophical themes seen in modern cosmology ‚Äî like the idea that the **ultimate source of the universe may be beyond empirical grasp**.

## üìñ The Story: *The Infinite Pillar of Light (Jyotirlinga)*

### üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Characters:

* **Brahma**: The creator god
* **Vishnu**: The preserver
* **Shiva**: The destroyer, appearing as an infinite pillar of light

---

### üïØÔ∏è The Central Event

Once, **Brahma and Vishnu** debated over **who was the supreme deity**.

* **Brahma claimed** he was the highest because he creates all beings.
* **Vishnu argued** he was the greatest since he sustains and preserves creation.

As they quarreled, **a blinding column of light (Jyotirlinga)** suddenly appeared, piercing through all realms ‚Äî with **no beginning or end**.

---

### üßó The Challenge

A **celestial voice** challenged both gods:

> ‚ÄúWhoever finds either the top or bottom of this column shall be declared the supreme.‚Äù

* **Vishnu** transformed into a **boar (Varaha)** and **dug downward** seeking the base.
* **Brahma** transformed into a **swan (hamsa)** and **flew upward** seeking the top.

---

### üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Outcome

* Vishnu **searched for thousands of years** downward but could not find the base. He returned and **honestly admitted** failure.
* Brahma **could not find the top** either, but on the way up he saw a **Ketaki flower** (screw pine) floating down. He **asked the flower to lie** for him, claiming it had seen Brahma reach the top.

Brahma returned and **falsely declared victory**, presenting the flower as proof.

---

### ‚ö° Shiva‚Äôs Revelation

At that moment, the **pillar of light split**, and **Shiva appeared**, **angrily condemning Brahma** for his dishonesty:

> ‚ÄúYou lied out of ego. From now on, you shall not be worshipped in any temple on Earth.‚Äù

This is why **Brahma has very few temples**, while Shiva and Vishnu are widely worshipped.

## üß† Parallels to Modern Thought

* The **infinite light** can be likened to the **Big Bang singularity** or **origin of the multiverse** ‚Äî a reality **beyond observation or comprehension**.
* The **efforts of Vishnu and Brahma** reflect **scientific inquiry** and **philosophical exploration** ‚Äî noble but ultimately limited in grasping the source of all.
* **Shiva as the source** parallels **Brahman**, or the **singular ultimate reality** from which all universes emerge and dissolve.
