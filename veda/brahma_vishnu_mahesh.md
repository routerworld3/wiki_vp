Yes — the story you’re referring to is a profound and symbolic tale from **Hindu cosmology**, found in **the Shiva Purana** and **Linga Purana**, involving **Brahma** and **Vishnu** trying to discover the origin of **a mysterious pillar of light**, which is ultimately revealed to be **Lord Shiva** in the form of an infinite **liṅga** (symbolic pillar).

This story not only illustrates the **limits of knowledge and ego**, but also strongly resembles philosophical themes seen in modern cosmology — like the idea that the **ultimate source of the universe may be beyond empirical grasp**.

## 📖 The Story: *The Infinite Pillar of Light (Jyotirlinga)*

### 🧙‍♂️ Characters:

* **Brahma**: The creator god
* **Vishnu**: The preserver
* **Shiva**: The destroyer, appearing as an infinite pillar of light

---

### 🕯️ The Central Event

Once, **Brahma and Vishnu** debated over **who was the supreme deity**.

* **Brahma claimed** he was the highest because he creates all beings.
* **Vishnu argued** he was the greatest since he sustains and preserves creation.

As they quarreled, **a blinding column of light (Jyotirlinga)** suddenly appeared, piercing through all realms — with **no beginning or end**.

---

### 🧗 The Challenge

A **celestial voice** challenged both gods:

> “Whoever finds either the top or bottom of this column shall be declared the supreme.”

* **Vishnu** transformed into a **boar (Varaha)** and **dug downward** seeking the base.
* **Brahma** transformed into a **swan (hamsa)** and **flew upward** seeking the top.

---

### 🧘‍♂️ The Outcome

* Vishnu **searched for thousands of years** downward but could not find the base. He returned and **honestly admitted** failure.
* Brahma **could not find the top** either, but on the way up he saw a **Ketaki flower** (screw pine) floating down. He **asked the flower to lie** for him, claiming it had seen Brahma reach the top.

Brahma returned and **falsely declared victory**, presenting the flower as proof.

---

### ⚡ Shiva’s Revelation

At that moment, the **pillar of light split**, and **Shiva appeared**, **angrily condemning Brahma** for his dishonesty:

> “You lied out of ego. From now on, you shall not be worshipped in any temple on Earth.”

This is why **Brahma has very few temples**, while Shiva and Vishnu are widely worshipped.
